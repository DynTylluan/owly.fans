		<p>Let's cast your mind back all the way to around 1220 or 1260, oh man, what a time to be alive, such fun times. During this period lived a boy in <a title="Великий Новгород." alt="Великий Новгород.">Novgorod</a> (now Veliky Novgorod, Russia) called Onfim. Sadly, very little is known about this child as a whole, but what we do know can be seen as a look in the mind of a Middle Ages child.</p>
			
			<p>Hi, I'm <font color="red">Xenia</font> and I've been looking at art by Onfim as of late and thought that I should make something that was inspired by him, so I wanted to make this little blag post about how much I love his art and the history behind it.</p>
			
		<p>During the 1200s in Russia, paper certainly did exist, *however*, it was costly to use, so the average person didn't make use of it, instead, they would opt to use bitch bark. Simply put, you would go in a forest, cut the top layer of skin off of the tree, boil it, and boom, you have something that you can write on by using your handy knife. These birch barks really weren't uncommon at all at the time, and in fact, Novgorod would even have a bit of deforestation in the area due to how popular this method would become.</p>

		<p>Of course, paper isn't even used that much anymore, the new king is, no shocker, now on phones. But let's set out minds back again to the 1200s. This birch bark writing method would be used like the way we would send simple text messages now. Here are some examples of birch letters that I found...</p>

XXX

		<p>Cool, right?</p>

		<p>Out of all of the examples of letters and birch, we find what I think is the biggest stand-out if them all: artwork by a child. Onfim.</p>

		<p>As I wrote at the start, *we don't know much about this little boyo*, all we know is that... drum roll... he lived between 1220 or 1260, his dad *might* have been a warrior, he was probably aged between 7 and 10 (based upon his handwriting), annnnd that's kind of where the paper trail (or BIRCH trail, hurt hur hur) ends.</p>

		<p>Write more like how he should have been doing school work but instead slacked off</p>

		<p>But why even write this blag post in the first place? Well, I feel like I </p>




		<p>With this being said, the main focus of this little blog will be upon showing Onfim's art.</p>

			I've been looking at art by Onfim as of late and thought that I should make something that was inspired by him, so I made this that says «I Am a Wild Beast» in his Old East Slavic language</p>
