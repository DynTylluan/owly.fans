<p>So a few months ago, I found out about <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/apelad/sets/72157600296941365">Laugh-Out-Loud Cats</a>, a cute Web-Comic that stars Pip and Kitteh, two homeless anthro cats that talk in internet slang a lot of the time. It was made by Adam "Ape Lad" Koford and I think it is <i>very</i> cute, so to honour this comic (a comic that is under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en">Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license</a>), here are some random comics from the series that I like a lot.</p>
				
				<p>I'll add alt text on this page later.</p>
