		<p><em>Cass Python, 20??-??-??</em></p>
		<p>Growing up queer was hard for me, I always <em>knew</em> that I was not like the other children, for one, I was very good at making friends with girls, I liked to play with dolls, and I had my hair grow out very long - of cource, I'm not going to sit down here and tell you that <em>just because</em> a boy likes to play with girls, dolls, and has long hair, then he is really a she, that would be out of line, but I feel like this and coulped by the fact that I found other boys my own age to be atractive should have made me relize a lot sooner that I was <em>not</em> stright and certally not cisgendered.</p>
		
		<p>I guess that I'm out here jumping the gun a bit with who I am. I'm Cass Python, hi, I currently see myself as a bisexual trans woman in her 20s, while I call myself bi and trans, if someone asked me what I <strong>am</strong>, like, what I <em>am-am</em>, I would say queer. I like the word queer, I find it to be such a great umbrella term for myself - I feel like if I were to ever relise that I am not a woman, then it woun't matter as I would still be queer.</p>
		
		<p>I feel like growning up queer for a young Cass was hard, on TV and in the movies, she knew of no other people like her that were shown. This was the early 2000s, so a child having acess to the Web was not all common as it is today, keep in mind, that the iPhone would only be released in Europe in 2007 and even at the time, they were not just somethign that you would give to a child. If you wanted to be entertained, then you had one real good answer: The TV.</p>
		
		<p>The idea of the TV is intresting, as unlike the Internt, it is linear, meaning that if there was a show that you <em>really</em> wanted to see, you had to sit down at a certan time and wait to see it with the rest of the contry. Personally, the idea of linear is very outdated to me, this might be as I saw the tailend of it, either way</p>
		
		<p>Terms such as LGBT+ are fine while talking to people not in the know-how (stright and cis people), but I feel like it can be quite a mouth-full at times, epecally as

	<p>Being first made in 1991, Linux is the name of a Unix-like operating system (or strictly family of) for computers - it is a bit like Windows or even macOS, but while those two examples are (mostly) closed sourced, Linux is based upon the idea of open-source and being free for everyone. Open-source means that anyone is more than welcome to browse the code for a project, seeing how and why it works the way that it does, even being allowed to download and make other versions of the code, depending on how liberal the owner of the product is.</p>

		<p>Some examples of projects that have open-source code are <a href="https://videolan.org/vlc" title="VLC media player website, link working as of 2021-12-24">VLC media player</a> that allows people to play audio and video files like MP3s, the web browser <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox" title="The Firefox website - might redirect to another URL, but will still be Firefox-related, link working as of 2021-12-24">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.blender.org" title="Blender website, link working as of 2021-12-24">Blender</a> (that allows you to make 3D artwork), and <a href="https://github.com/DynTylluan/owly.fans/tree/main/xenia" title="Git for this webpage, link working as of 2021-12-24">even this text</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Other examples include classic computer games from the over-the-top fun with <u><a alt="ROTT" title="Rise of the Triad: Dark War (1995) by Apogee Software - also called 'Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins' with the shareware version, published in 1994." href="https://github.com/videogamepreservation/rott">Rise of the Triad</a></u>, heavy metal inspired <u><a alt="Doom" title="Doom (1993) by id Software - Doom II (1995) is also open-source." href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">Doom</a></u>, the simple but yet fun text adventure <u><a alt="Zork" title="Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (1979, also just called 'Zork I') by the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group." href="https://github.com/devshane/zork">Zork</a></u>, and even the silly but-yet somehow bad-ass <u><a alt="Duke" title="Duke Nukem 3D (1996) by 3D Realms." href="https://github.com/videogamepreservation/dukenukem3d">Duke Nukem 3D</a></u>.</p>
		
		<p>All of the previus examples of the computer games were all from large, well established companies, that are willing to publish their source code to their older titles as they know that their competaters will not likly us the source code and if they did, then it would be only a tiny amount. A company such as id Software can benafit by releasing the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_source_code">source code to, say, Doom</a>, as thanks to that, modding of the game can become even better, allowing people to make their own source ports for it, exspaning on it and even being able to make entialy new games using the code written by someone else. This will benfait id Software in this example, as by making their games open source, it encorages peolple to stay loyal to the company thanks to the modding community that has been made by this action and that people will start to trst them as they will see that id Software isn't just publishing games for the sake of money, rather the comunity - this in-turn will make it more likly that when id Software release a new Doom game, it will have a garateaned profit.</p>

		<p>If the source for Doom was not made public, then this might have resulted in 2016's Doom making far less of a profit, not encoraging id Software, now owned by Bethesda Softworks that since got bought up by Microsoft, to put as much effort into develaping the game then they might have of.</p>
		
		<p>Open-source isn't just good for the user-base of computer games, it can also help communication, such as with <a alt="IRC" title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</a>, that was created by Jarkko Oikarinen in August 1988, and is still going strong today, even in modern-day <script type="text/javascript">
var today = new Date()
var year = today.getFullYear()
document.write(year)
			</script> - if the protocol was not open, then communication in the early days of the Internet would have been even more slow then they were at the time, and remember, this was <em>years</em> before the days of even Skype, Discord, or Zoom.</p>
		
		<p>Open-source can also be exstreamly inportant, as if something such as <a alt="HTML" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> was never made avalible for public use, then the whole face of the <a alt="Web vs Internet" title="The World Wide Web (WWW) is *not* the Internet, think of the Internet as a roadway to the Web that is a house full of media that you, the viewer, can see.">Web</a> would not be the same at all, and in fact, people like Al Mackey (who we will see later) might not have been able to publish their art as easy if the Web were to say closed.</p>

		<p>Such benafits of open-source projects, over closed-sourced, is that anyone can review the code at no cost apart from their time, allowing to see any errors that might occure with the program, for an example, while looking at the source for <u><a alt="GIMP" title="GNU Image Manipulation Program." href="https://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a></u>, a person may find something wrong with it - because of this, they<sup><a href="#note-001">[note 001]</a></sup> could easaly inform the head(s) of the project that there is an error in the source code, how to fix an issue, or even submit their own code as a way of getting things to work in the right way. This is sometimes seen in closed-sourced projects, althought it is more likly that the head(s) would pay someone to review the code and disallowed him/her<sup><a href="#note-001b">[note 001b]</a></sup> to acually publish said code, in fear of legial ramafacations.</p>

		<p>In a way, closed-source can seem better from the outside; it is much more easy to make a profit off of it and peopel can not recyle your code and use your <em>hard work</em> for free in their own project, althoguht it can be less sucure and more vonable, such as with Microsoft's Windows that has a whole market around selling anti-virus softwear - a market that just is not a thing for the Linux community, as if there is a vonability in the code, then people will not only point it out, but write their own code that can be used.</p>

		<p>Because of this, a person could say that Linux is in fact <em>better</em> than their closed-sourced counter parts, Windows and macOS.</p>

		<p>However, in June 2021, roundable only 2.68% of the desktop operating system market share worldwide ran Linux<sup><a href="#ref-019">[019]</a></sup>, despite of this 81% of all smartphones are powered by Linux<sup><a href="#ref-020">[020]</a></sup>, while 96.5% of all of the top one million domains in the world (as ranked by Alexa) use Linux<sup><a href="#ref-021">[021]</a></sup>, and the top 500 supercomputers run it also<sup><a href="#ref-018">[018]</a></sup>.</p>

		<p>As with a lot of good projects, especally one that was quciky growing, Linux needed a mascot, so in 1996, under the suggestion of Alan Cox, Larry Ewing made the mascot a penguin, being approved by Linus Torvalds (the father of Linux) soon after<sup><a href="#ref-003">[003]</a></sup>. Much like Xenia, Tux (as seen on the right), was not given a name at first - James Hughes came up with the idea of giving them their name, suggesting to call the penguin Tux, that (fun fact) is short for <strong>T</strong>orvalds <strong>U</strong>ni<strong>X</strong><sup><a href="#ref-004">[004]</a></sup> and also the name Tux also finds its roots in the word <strong>tux</strong>edo as penguins look as if they are wearing a black tuxedo<sup><a href="#ref-005">[005]</a></sup>. Other names that people came up with was Homer, as suggested by Linus Torvalds (it was the height of <em>The Simpsons</em> after all).</p>

		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computing_mascots">Tux is certainly not the <em>only</em> mascot to be used for open source projects</a> and in fact, there have even been a number of furry mascots over the years for open-source projects with the likes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU#Logo">GNU head</a>, Kiki the Cyber Squirrel for <a href="https://krita.org">Krita</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AROS_Research_Operating_System#Name_and_identity">Kitty the mascot for AROS Research Operating System (AROS - as seen on the right)</a>, the latter of the three being what most people would call the most <em>anthropomorphic</em><sup><a href="#note-002">[note 002]</a></sup> of the lot.</p>
		
		<p>Anthropomorphic mascots are also very common outside of the world of computers also, such as with the Summer Youth Olympics that quite often have cute and cuddly characters representing them with the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyo_and_Merly">Lyo and Merly (2010)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Winter_Youth_Olympics#Mascot">Yodli (2020)</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Winter_Youth_Olympics#Mascot">Sjogg (2016)</a>.</p>

		<p>Out of all of the open-source mascots, Tux is the most well-known of them all, <a href="https://www.supertux.org/">being</a> <a href="https://libregamewiki.org/Extreme_Tux_Racer">used</a> <a href="https://supertuxkart.net">in</a> <a href="https://libregamewiki.org/SuperTuxParty">games</a>, logos, and even being seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu0KKEuY11s">an ad for Froot Loops</a> of all things.</p>

		<p>The reason as to <em>why</em> the mascot for Linux turned out to be a penguin is quite simple as Linus Torvalds just <em>likes</em> the animal, as relieved in this E-Mail that was published via a Linux mailing list<sup><a href="#ref-017">[017]</a></sup>;</p>

Re: Linux Logo<br>

Umm.. You don't have any gap to fill in.
<br><br>
"Linus likes penguins". That's it. There was even a headline on it in some Linux Journal some time ago (I was bitten by a Killer Penguin in Australia - I'm not kidding). Penguins are fun.
<br><br>
As to why use a penguin as a logo? No good reason, really. But a logo doesn't really [h]ave to <em>mean</em> anything - it's the association that counts. And I can think of many worse things than have linux being associated with penguins.
<br><br>
Having a penguin as a logo also gives more freedom to people wanting to use linux-related material: instead of being firmly fixed with a specific logo (the triangle, or just "Linux 2.0" or some other abstract thing), using something like a penguin gives people the chance to make modifications that are still recognizable. 
<br><br>		<figure>
        <center><a href="xenia_al_mackey.gif"><img src="xenia_al_mackey.png" alt="Linux Fox" title="Linux Fox, the mascot with 'real attitude' is an anthropomorphic fox with blond hair, glasses and a black t-shirt that says 'LINUX' on in green." width="192" height="360"></a></center>

    </figure>
So you can have a real live penguin on a CD cover, for example, and people will get the association. Or you can have a penguin that does something specific (a Penguin writing on wordperfect for the WP Linux CD, whatever - you get the idea).
<br><br>
Compare that to a more abstract logo (like the windows logo - it's not a bad logo in itself). You can't really do anything with a logo like that. It just "is".
<br><br>

		<p>Despite Tux being approved by the creator of Linux himself, some people did not think that the fat penguin represented the over-all vibe of the community, so at least three sets of votes took place in 1996 to decide who, <em>or what</em>, should be the mascot of Linux<sup><a href="#ref-006">[006]</a></sup>.</p>

		<p>At the time, furry artiest Al Mackey submitted <strong>Linux Fox</strong>, "a Linux mascot with real meaning (and real attitude)"<sup><a href="#ref-006">[006]</a></sup> (it <em>was</em> the 1990s after all). Linux Fox (also called "LinuxFox" with no spaces) was described as being "designed to be the #1 competitor to a certain cute and cuddly penguin. The penguin is nice and all, but it doesn't really remind me[, Al Mackey,] of a lean and mean multitasking/networking machine. LinuxFox, on the other hand, is clearly a hard-core Linux coder. :-)"<sup><a href="#ref-007">[007]</a></sup>.</p>

		<p>Linux Fox did okay in the contest, coming up in third place, getting 280 votes<sup><a href="#ref-006">[006]</a></sup>, getting beaten by Matt Ericson's design that was simply just the word "Linux" with the "i" being replaced with a lightbulb and Tux the penguin, the latter being the winner.</p>

		<p>In the end, Tux would became the defacto-mascot for Linux and a symble for open-source as a whole while <em>Linux Fox</em> would become forgotten by most. As time passed, not all that much happened regarding the anthropomorphic fox for about two or so years, in that time in 1997, Linux Fox <em>was</em> seen on a t-shirt of artwork showing Nervick, a fursona of Tomas Manley in 1997<sup><a href="#ref-008">[008]</a></sup> made by Al Mackey, but apart from this, that was it -- there was seemingly no other fan artwork made of the anthropomorphic fox at the time.</p>

		</figcaption>
    </figure>
			<p>Time would pass and people moved on - Al Mackey would start work at HP in June 1998 to June 2000, moving to Virage in October 2000 to August 2002<sup><a href="#ref-009">[009]</a></sup>. At the same time, they carried on making art and music, even selling a CD-ROM that boasted about having "over 200 pictures by ATM himself, including several items unreleased anywhere else. Also, over one hour of music, local versions of two web-games, and a tutorial of Photoshop techniques"<sup><a href="#ref-010">[010]</a></sup>.</p>
		
		<p>As of this article being published, Al himself is still making artwork to this day, making majority adult cartoons of anthropomorphic animals<sup><a href="#note-003">[note 003]</a></sup>, posting on <a href="https://furaffinity.net/user/nanimoose">their Fur Affinity regally since 2006</a><sup><font color="red">[NSFW]</font></sup> and also in 2019, moving to their own website, <a href="https://nanimoo.se"><strong>NaniMoose's Smut Emporium</strong></a><sup><font color="red">[NSFW]</font></sup> where they also post their artwork, a lot of which goes back to the "the early 'aughts"<sup><a href="#ref-015">[015]</a></sup>.</p>

	<p>The artwork of Al himself has changed a lot since the 1990s, this can be best seen by comparing his work from then and now - Al has clearly moved from using a mouse to using a drawing tablet. As with a lot of artiests, Al's style has settled down a lot and has clearly improved a lot, becoming almost unrecanisable.</p>

		<h2><a href="#Xenia Part II: The fOX Project">Xenia Part II: The fOX Project</a><a name="Xenia Part II: The fOX Project"></a></h2>

<p>Since it was decided that Tux should be the official mascot for Linux, even been seen in many a <a href="https://libregamewiki.org/Tux">free software game</a>, <em>Linux Fox</em> essentially was not fully representing any  <em>real</em> product or idea at all, until 1998 When <em>The fOX Project</em>  was started, it was seemingly made with the aim of making "usefull applications for UN*X in an organized fashion"<sup><a href="#ref-013">[013]</a></sup>:
									<p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>The fOX Project is a an[sic] attempt to create a suite of usefull applications for UN*X in an organized fashion. With the help of developers worldwide, and with the use of the Xclass toolkit by Hector Peraza, this project has become a reality.</p>
							
<p>The Xclass Toolkit provides a simple and uniform way for programmers to access widgets that have the Windows 95 3D look and feel. The fOX Project extends on the "Windows 95 look" by providing a set of standards to insure good code quality, as well as good GUI designs. This project also attempts to provide a starting ground for fledgling C++/X11 programers (such as myself ;-) by providing project ideas as well as design standards.</p>
		</blockquote>

				<p>As it so happened, Linux Fox would be used for the seemingly now-discontinued software, although no new artwork of them was made, rather it was chosen that the project head(s) would simply recycle the first drawing of Linux Fox for their own needs. Credit was given to the origin of Linux Fox, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121181236/http://www.foxproject.org/about/fox-support.html">with a link to the source to the anthro fox</a>, although Al Mackey was not named on the credit page, the same goes for the rest of the people who worked on the project and as foxproject.org has been off since around 2008. Although this may not be fully correct, as the website has sadly not been fully archived via <a alt="What is The Internet Archive?" title="The Internet Archive is an online library that, among other things, has saved over 580 billion web pages in the Wayback Machine, allowing anyone to see what most websites looked like at the time that it was saved, for example, you can see what Google looked like in the year 2000.">The Internet Archive</a>, the history of the project has seemingly been lost, although <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010215044124fw_/http://www.foxproject.org/devel/">we can see a list of programs made</a>: OXProgBar, OXFont (not a program, but still of note), OXStatusBar, OXResizer, and OXMdi.</p>

		<p>Sadly, much like a lot of the site, the programs have also been lost and searching up terms like <tt>The fOX Project</tt> on a search engine today only shows up with non-reverent links.</p>

		<p>Related, but in 1997 a project by the name of FOX toolkit was set up, a "C++ based Toolkit for developing Graphical User Interfaces easily and effectively. It offers a wide, and growing, collection of Controls, and provides state of the art facilities such as drag and drop, selection, as well as OpenGL widgets for 3D graphical manipulation. FOX toolkit also implements icons, images, and user-convenience features such as status line help, and tooltips.

			<p>23 years after the (nerdy) world saw <em>Linux Fox</em>, nothing happened (or at least nothing happened that was <em>documented</em>), until in 2019 when finley of <a href="https://twitter.com/cathodegaytube">@cathodegaytube</a>'s girlfriend showed her Linux Fox, as finley is an illustrator, she drew her own interpretation of the fox (as seen on the right), mostly keeping to the design of the original 1990s-look Al Mackey had given to them - an interesting misunderstanding that finley made was mistaking that Al had designed them to be female, writing that "apparently the Linux mascot was almost a cool fox girl and everyone seems to have forgotten about her, so naturally i drew her!"<sup><a href="#ref-011">[011]</a></sup>.

	<p>At the same time, finley had been in contact with Al Mackey via E-Mail and in a Twitter thread showing the new artwork, finley showed screenshots of Al talking about Linux Fox and how that finley's girlfriend, Amy Wright of <a href="https://twitter.com/AmyWrightDev">@AmyWrightDev</a>, decided to rename Linux Fox to Xenia<sup><a href="#ref-012">[012]</a></sup>:</p>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>The fox was intended to be male, although certainly drawn fairly androgynously.. But to me your interpretation of her as female actually makes a lot of sense, especially in the context of time. It matches the transitions of a lot of the smartest, nerdiest Linux users I know.</p>
				
				<p>And sure, you made her trans! Yes, feel free to run down these emails too. Xenia seems like a very appropriate name. I just read <a alt="Mythos: The Greek Myths Retold (2017)" title="Mythos: The Greek Myths Retold (2017)">Stephen Fry's Mythos</a> and he has a lot to say about the ancient Greek concept of Xenia<sup><a href="#note-0004">[note 004]</a></sup>. What a weird coincidence.</p>

		<p>Another interesting development of this thread was that we got to find out that the original 1996 drawing was made on an Amiga (a family of PCs introduced by Commodore that would be discontinued also in 1996) on a mouse (a lot of artists prefer using something such as a digital drawing tablet<sup><a href="#note-0005">[note 005]</a></sup> today) and that Al's brother, Ed, "who was more involved with Linux at the time, was the one tht[sic] prompted [Al] to enter the contest"<sup><a href="#ref-012">[012]</a></sup>.</p>
			
			<p>On <a alt="ISO 8601" title="ISO 8601 date format for the 7th of June 2020">2020-06-07</a>, this information would become public knowledge when finley would make a post about it on her Twitter<sup><a href="#ref-012">[012]</a></sup>, along with new artwork of Xenia showing her with the trans pride flag, cementing her as a transfeminine<sup><a href="#note-0005">[note 005]</a></sup> character not only in the eyes of fans but also the creator. While it might have just been a change, the new artwork of Xenia was posted in June, which so also happened to be Pride Month.</p>
			
			<p>While there was artwork of Xenia <em>before</em> this date, not much was made: On <a alt="ISO 8601" title="ISO 8601 date format for the 1st of December 2019">2019-12-01</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AmyNewBlue/status/1201015518192291841">Amy New made a portrait</a> after they "Decided to draw the Linux fox mascot", then on <a alt="ISO 8601" title="ISO 8601 date format for the 13th of March 2020">2020-05-13</a> Marbles <a href="https://twitter.com/marbles_hyena/status/1260609397832577025">published a number of work-in-progress sketches of the fox</a>, as commissioned by unknown.</p>

		<p>As with a lot of charaters that get popaler on the Web, Xenia has had a number of artwork made that has her as the main focus of the it. Despite Linux being built from the grownd up as free and open source, a lot of artwork of the anthro fox is not open source at all, rather having an unknown lisences - along with this, the original 1996 artwork of Xenia is in fact <em>not fully</em> open source, only allowing people to freely share the artwork as long as it has "anything having to do with Linux"<sup><a href="#ref-007">[007]</a></sup>. Despite of this, there is artwork of Xenia that is indeed using some sort of open lisence for its artwork.
		
		</p>
		
			<p>With the rise of the popuality of Xenia, the website <strong><a href="https://xenia-linux-site.glitch.me">Xenia, the Linux mascot</a></strong> was setup by Efi of <a href="https://efi.glitch.me">efi.glitch.me</a>, being made to showcase a number of artwork of the fox and give the reader a breafe history</p>
		 
		<p>Another thing that would that help Xenia gain popuality would be a video by <a title="Tech reviewer as well as person who reports on Linux news and related things - mostly in the vain of open-source">Immy of Linux Lounge</a>, who's early 2021 video on Xenia, <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b4eW1KAuWE" title="The Story of Xenia - Linux's Forgotten Mascot! - YouTube, link working as of 2021-12-24">The Story of Xenia - Linux's Forgotten Mascot!</a></strong>, has been able to reach a small audiance of people </p>

<p>Media, such as televiisn, movies, and cartoons have been littered with duble meaning since day one - there are second meanings to almost everything that you consume, we learne this in school. I destincly remember having to analize the stories by <a alt="Birth and death of Shakespeare" title="c. 1564-04-26 - 1616-04-26.">William Shakespeare</a>, having to read and review such works as <em><a alt="Midsummer" title="Published 1605.">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></em> and <em><a alt="Tempest" title="Published 1610 to 1611.">The Tempest</a></em>, having to disect these clasics that I learnt to hatedue to how they were put upon me by my English teachers (but disliking Shakespeare due to how much he is used in schools is not the point of this article).</p>

		<p>It is almost inposible to find something in media that cannot be analized due to its dubble meaning - people can even find meaning in things that are just not there

        <figcaption><p>Fanart of Moxxie from Helluva Boss, by <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/art/view/stellarstories/moxxie-2">Madam</a>, is an example of a charater from non-madstream media whom is LGBT+, in this case, he is bisexual, being married to this wife, Millie.</p>
		<p>Click for full image.</a>
		</figcaption>
    </figure>
		
		<p>Set in the Underworld, Helluva Boss follows the black comedy and musical adventures of the Immediate Murder Professionals, or I.M.P., an assassination business that offers to other resudents in Hell, the service of killing living people on Earth as a way of settling any unfinished business. The show itself was a spin-off of Hazbin Hotel, an another cartoon by Vivienne "VivziePop" Medrano, that also has queer repusentation. Helluva Boss is a tigtly-written show that has a welcome-amount of LGBT+ charaters that are cannon in the lore of the show itself, rather than fans of the show reliying on fan theories.</p>
		
		<p>Queer sexualities and non-cis gender identies of the resudents of the cartoon are seen as a norm in much of the works by VivziePop, such as with Princess Charlie Magne, who is bisexual<!-- (https://twitter.com/VivziePop/status/1050498176019353601 https://twitter.com/VivziePop/status/1308964753570754562 -->, having a girlfriend and formally an ex-boyfriend. In the spin-off show, Helluva Boss, a majour plot point is that the head of the I.M.P, Blitzo, has a book that allows himself and his fellow imp-co-workers to the land of the living, this is acheaved thanks to Blitzo sleeping with Stolas, the Prince of the Ars Goetia. Later in the show, <span class="spoiler-text" tabindex="0">their relation take off in more than a phisical relationship, with both seemaly becoming semi-lovers</span>, agian, this is seen as a norm within the show, the idea of this is flirted with in the episode of Loo Loo Land, where Princess Octavia confrunts her father, Stolas, on <span class="spoiler-text" tabindex="0">having an affear with another man</span> - the issue that Octavia has is that her <span class="spoiler-text" tabindex="0">father is sleeping with another person that is not his wife, rather the the fact that it is <em>another</em> man</span>.</p>

		<p>Most of the cast of both Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel, disregarding a few, are all bad people, but despite of this, it is reasuring to see not only a show where there is no doubt queer reputation, but also a show that is headed by a bisexual woman, Vivienne Medrano. Due to the themes of the program itself, it is helped that the prorgam was not picked up by a mainstream broadcaster that would have probally made a bastardised version of VivziePop's idea for the show. Becasue of this, it means that the program is free to be more libral in the themes that it shows.</p>
		
		<p>People have been able to upload almost anything to the Web for well over 20-years-now, with websites like Newgrounds in the late 1990s to early 2000s and later YouTube onwards, despuite of this, mainstream media like televisiion is less lucky in what it can and cannot broudcast. In a lot of cases, this can be a good thing, for example, in the United Kingdom, watershed, the time of day after which programming aimed towards mature or adult audiences is permitted, is <a alt="19:00" title="9PM">19:00</a>, before this time, using fowl langauge is <em>usally</em> not permited.

		<p>The following deals with sexual assult, skip to the next chapter to not read it.</p>

		<p>While there are a number of charaters in the mainstream media that has good examples of good repasentation (mostly to do with LGB charaters), there are still much of media that has bad examples of repasentation of what it is like to be queer, one such example of this is in the 1986 classic Crocodile Dundee, an admitaly fun movie about a fish-out-of-water, in this case, Mick, who finds himself from the Outback to the world of New York City. In the movie, that has the honor of being one of the most viewed films on British TV, Mick finds himself in a bar with a taxi driver whith whom he made friends with. In the scean, a woman is flirting with the Ozzy, whome is enjoying the attention, but it is revieled to Mick that she "ain't no sheela"<!-- (note: I nned to make sure that this is the quote used) -->, to test out to see if this person is a <em>real</em>sheela, Mick goes up to her and grabs her crotch, being able to feel her genatals - after this, the whole bar laught at her as she runs away in shame.</p>	
	
	<p>As Luke Buckmaster wrote for The Guardian in 2018:<!--https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/23/crocodile-dundee-was-sexist-racist-and-homophobic-lets-not-bring-that-back--></p>
		
	<p><blockquote>Mick Dundee ([Paul] Hogan) chats up a trans woman, before a friend pulls him aside: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been trying to tell you all night, that girl, she&#x2019;s a guy!&#x201D; Dundee responds by sexual assaulting her. He grabs the woman in the groin area, then points and yells: &#x201C;A guy dressed up like a sheila! Look at that!&#x201D;</p>

<p>The pub erupts into laughter and applause. There are high fives and back slaps.</p>

<p>Dundee sexually assaults another women later on, in the same way, at an art gallery. His love interest Sue (Linda Kozlowski) consoles the distraught woman by saying: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s OK, he&#x2019;s Australian.&#x201D;</blockquote></p>		
	
		<p>The joke here is that she was not a <em>real</em> woman (despite being played by actress Anne Carlisle, whom is cis) so Mick was justafiyed in sexually assulting her. The scean is very alkward to view and quite uncomftable, what failes to help it is that the movie treats it as a joke - would Mick's actions be funny and justafiyed if it was reveled that she was cis?</p>

		<p>Media can also have well-intent when it comes to showing LGBT+ themes, Photos From Buster (name-check) was a spin-off of PBS's Arther series where Buster traves the United States, getting to visit people who's way of life might not be fully known to children. One of the episodes, shown in 200?, had a lesbian cuble and their children. The segment of the show itself was not partically pro-or-anti LGBT+, all it was was that it simply said that these people exiest in our world, despite of this, people were not happy about this.</p>
	
	This is not the only case where showing an LGBT+ charater has caused issues, in their 2017, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1ix93_HR4c">South Park vs Mainstream Media: LGBT Representation</a>, video Jess Dotson made an intresting point when they talk about <em>gay for pay</em>,

		 <p id="note-001">Note 001: Transgeaner moment<br>
			 In too many science, police, and other reports, I see the term &#x22;he or she&#x22; come up a fair bit, I personally find this term to not be only outdated, but also quite clunky - in my opinion, the reason why it sounds clunky as if you, the reporter, have to refer to a person a lot, reading &#x22;he/she&#x22; can show down the process for the viewer of your report.
			 
		<p>I, Cass Python, also find it to be an outdated term as, well, it&#x27;s the year 20-something, and the idea of non-binary people is becoming more and more excepted - it just seems weird that someone would want to exclude these people in our progressive world where trans people, rightfully so, are becoming more and more excepted.</p>
		
		<p>Although, I can understand why the police would want to excuse trans people - I doubt that they will be willing to be progressive anytime soon.</p>
		
		<p>For more on this, Tom Scott did a very good video on this subject: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ehrFk-gLk">Gender Neutral Pronouns: They're Here, Get Used To Them</a>.</p>
		
		 <p id="note-001b">Note 001b: Transgeaner moment part II<br>
		Seems odd now that it's been pointed out.
			 
		 <p id="note-002">Note 002: Anthropomorphic???<br>
			 Meaning to give human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human things - properties like Tom and Jerry, Mickey Mouse, and Buggs Bunny are all examples of classic cartoons that give human traits to animals.
		
		 <p id="note-003">Note 003: Yiff<br>
			 Known in the furry fandom as &#x22;yiff&#x22;; As with a lot of fandoms made up of adults, sex and pornography is an important facet to it, much like how hentai (drawn adult cartoons) is a part of the anime fandom.
			 
		<p>Furries are humans after all, so, naturally, sex would be a part of it.</p>
		
		<p>Unlike the anime community, the furry fandom itself is made up of a lot of people that self-identify as being LGBT+. There have been multiple estimates of the percentage of LGBT+ people in the fandom, with the number usually being high, possibly as high as 90%, but polls have shown differences in estimations.</p>
		
		<p>This article isn&#x27;t about the sexuality of people, but if you want to learn more, going to <a href="https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/LBGT_in_the_furry_fandom">https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/LBGT_in_the_furry_fandom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Sexual_orientation">https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Sexual_orientation</a> is a good starting place.</p>
		
		 <p id="note-004">Note 004: What is Xenia?<br>
			 In ancient Greek lore, Xenia (or &#x22;&#x3BE;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3AF;&#x3B1;&#x22;) is the concept of hospitality and is mostly translated as &#x22;guest-friendship or &#x22;ritualized friendship&#x22;.
		
		 <p id="note-00">note 00: Digital drawing tablet note<br>
			 Also known as a digitizer, drawing pad, digital drawing tablet, pen tablet, or digital art board.
			 
		 <p id="note-00">note 00: Transfeminine???<br>
			 As in a trans person that identifies as female, also known as just transfem.
			 
		<p>The masculine equivalent of transfeminine is transmasculine or transmasc.</p>
