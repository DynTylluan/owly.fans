<h1>Issues with Linux</h1>
<hr>
<p>Here are a list of errors that I have come across while using Linux, if anyone knows how to fix these issues, please do say.</p>
		<p>I am running Manjaro Xfce</p>
		<p>IMO, the fact that I even had to <em>make</em> this page says how much of a joke Linux is</p>
	<p>I do not recommend Linux to anyone as I now know that Linux is not only broken, but the community is full of people who harass and bully others who do not use a distro. While I am very much in favor of open-source (most things I have made (if not all) online use an open licence) I will have to admit that in comparison, Windows is so much better than whatever half-arsed rubbish that is Linux.</p>
<p>Please do not use Linux, it is not only broken, impossible to understand, and uses strange decisions, but the community itself is terrible.</p>

		<p>After having my computer off for a while, I uninstalled the bastard and reinstalled it, with it now working.</p>
		<p>Pog.</p>
		<p>This issue was also seen at the sametime via the <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/catfish-file-search-is-not-working-since-stable-update-on-2021-07-28/75889">Manjaro Linux Forum</a> where the answer was to just update again and it should work.</p>
		<p>Thank you to vanta of <a href="https://vantaa.black/">vantaa.black</a> for help with this issue.</tr>

					  <p>The issue here was that in Firefox (not Linux), I had push notifs from an unwanted website - <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox?as=u#w_how-do-i-revoke-web-push-permissions-for-a-specific-site">I followed this guide</a> that <a href="https://rocks.cd5k.net/">Bytemoth</a> showed me. The old issue is seen here:</p>

		<p>Delete the equivalent of EXE as the not-EXE was not fully installed?? What?? This makes no sense - Linux is testing me to see how long it will take until I lose it. This is fucking stupid.</p>

	  <p>Is this a fucking joke? On Windows, all I do is press is Ctrl+Shift+e to make é, Ctrl+Shift+a to make á, etc - this is so simple to remember, so much better than a bunch of fucking random numbers.</p></td>
