		<p>How to say my name: <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%2Fk%C3%A6s%20%CB%88pa%C9%AA%CE%B8%C9%99n%2F&voice=Geraint">/kÃ¦s ËˆpaÉªÎ¸É™n/</a></p>
<p>Why hello there, so then, you clicked on that link - that was very brave of you, and you know what? I respect you for that, I like brave people like yourself, anyway, welcome to my about me page (woo!). To tell you honestly, I am not quite sure what to really put here, so rather than the normal rubbish that you might see on a website, I took inspiration from my biggest hero; myself. You see, all the way back in 2019, I made a little project called <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/2095/">2095: Not Quite Human</a> where I got Talk to Transformer, a "modern neural network", to write sci-fi stories - so just for the Hell of it, I got the neural network to write my bio. So, everything written in this style was written by me, a human, <strong>while the text in bold was made by the network, a soulless being</strong>.</p>

<p>To start the bot off, I needed to give it a prompt, so, without any further playing around, enjoy my bio:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello there, I'm Cass and to tell you a bit about myself</p>
<p><strong>I am a young woman of just twenty - three.</p>
<p>I went to the police academy for a short while, but then ran off and got married.</p>
<p>Now I have a baby girl called Candy, who is a complete pain in the arse.</p>
<p>It's all thanks to my ex - husband that I have this baby.</p>
<p>He had a birthday party for his thirtieth birthday and I went.</p>
<p>Well, you know what they say about girls and their ex - husbands.</p>
<p>They don't get along.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was so drunk that I let him think that I'd still be awake when he got</p></strong>
<p>I enjoy updating my website, browsing art website, talking to my friends, but what I really like the most is<strong> to draw my own art.</p>
<p>In addition to everything I'm interested in, I can never get enough of drawing.</p>
<p>I'm hooked on it.</p>
<p>Also I want to know if it's really possible to be really good at drawing.</p>
<p>I am not perfect but I have also bought some drawing books to learn from.</p>
<p>My drawing skill is always improving, sometimes even being better than professional artists.</p>
<p>You can be a really good artist.</p>
<p>It takes years to become really good.</p>
<p>Good artists work hard at their work, and they are always</p></strong>
<p>Please do not contact me if you <strong>are seeking dating assistance as I am not a professional and can only offer my personal opinion.</p>
<p>The beauty of the Internet is that you can research as much or as little as you want about your prospective dates before ever meeting.</p>
<p>If you prefer to meet someone through an actual dating service, please consult with your service provider.</p>
<p>I will continue to use Plenty of Fish as I have not found any other site as useful as it has been for me.</p>
<p>I would like to hear your opinion on my dating</p></strong></blockquote>
<p>Uh, well then, that was -- pointless.</p>
