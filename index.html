<p>With howling throughout the trees, your hope slowly dies out as the rain starts to hit even harder upon your uncovered head. This was anything but friendly land that you had the misfortune to stumble upon after getting lost from your party. Your hunger grows as your body becomes weak, but just then a guardian angel comes to your aid, an angel in the form of a light shining from a log cabin window.</p>

<p>You make your way there, almost tripping over yourself in the slow and painful walk to this bastion of new hope.</p>

<p>The door to the building creaks open. It's all but dark inside, but what was the light you saw? Standing proud at a desk lay a computer screen, a mouse, and keyboard. On it showed the website for www dot owly dot fans, a website by <a href="me/">Cass</a>. You smile knowing that it was all worth it in the end. Sitting down at the chair, your next option will be the most important one... where on the website do you wish to visit first?</p>
