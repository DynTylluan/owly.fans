<p>Hi there, and if you read the title of this page right, then you'd know that I'm Cass (they/she). To tell a little about myself, I am a nerd from the UK who has a strong passion for all things relating to the world of ICT, as well as the preservation of software, the Web, and other things relating to the Internet as a whole. In my spare time, I help run <a href="https://neozones.club">NeoZones</a>, a webhost for myself and a few other of my friends, I am also rather active on <a href="https://neozones.club/discord">its Discord server</a> - do feel free to join, we won't bite, I can tell you that!</p>
<p>As I also go by the name Owly online, I thought it would be funny of me to buy the domain owly.fans for a decade as it sounds a bit like the name of a certain other website full of fans. If you want, you can also find me on <a href="https://digipres.club/@OwlMan">my Masto</a> where I post about a bunch of rubbish that you may (or more likely, may <em>not</em>) find interesting.</p>
<p>This site is growing all of the time, so do make sure that you add it to your bookmarks on your browser (<a href="https://mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">use Firefox</a>) and come back whenever.</p>
