<p>Saluton,
		<p>The other day on a <a href="https://neozones.club/discord">Discord server that I run</a>, we were talking about wugs after I posted a <a href="../../odds/20210915_030902.jpg">quick chalk drawing I made</a> and a friend of mine asked what wugs are - just to recap, this is the second artwork of a wug that I have published on here, so if you want an overview of what they are,a nd why this art is CC0, <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/41267212">read the bio for this art here</a></p>

<p>This was made in Tux Paint and... yeah, it kind of shows. It's not the *best* thing that I have ever made, plus I gave this wug arms (or fins, depending on if you think a wug is a fish or bird) - I guess this could have been me taking influence from <a href="https://pinkwug.live">PinkWug</a> - who knows! (<a href="https://pinkwug.live/comics/recycled">By the way, I really like this comic here</a>)</p>

<p>ANYWAY! As I said, I don't feel like this is the best thing that I have ever made, and to be honest, I might remake this in MS Paint (I will try and do that today, 2020-09-16), but we will see, won't we?</p>
