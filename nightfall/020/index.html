<h3><p>Happy Birthday, Paul!</p></h3>
		<p>This review was published on 2023-11-14, AKA <strong>Paul McGann's 64th birthday!!</strong> So to honor this day, everyone now needs to stand up and sing at their screen. Are you ready?</p>
		<p>Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to Paul, happy birthday to yooou~! Yaaay!!!</p>
	</div>
			<p>When it comes to Doctor Who, I've been a fan for a fair time now, in fact, I can still cast my mind back to 2005 when the first episode of nuWho aired; that being Rose. I still remember my mom and dad sitting me in front of the TV at the time, telling me that I might like what I was about to watch. To be honest, yeah, they were more than right. I became a lifelong fan of the show from that point on.</p>
			<p>I don't know what it was like for people not in the UK at the time, but me being a fan of this nerdy show wasn't something to be ashamed of at all, and in fact, most of my friends that I knew at school were also fans of the Doctor's adventures and were more than happy to play make-pretend with me in the playground (I should say that I was like, nine-years-old).</p>

<p><figure>

					<figcaption><p>Sylvester McCoy played the Time Lord from 1987 until the show was axed in 1989 due to reasons such as poor reviews.</p>
		</figcaption>
		</figure></p>

<p>I had Doctor Who toys, books, comics, plus some random audio dramas on CD, so I think it's fair to say that I thrived on this show. When it came to my knowledge, I was aware that there were episodes for the show pre-dating 2005's <em>Rose</em>, but I never got to really watch them. I think I'm going to blame this on the fact that the BBC never reran the episodes on TV (and still don't really do this), so I missed out on a good 25 plus years of Doctor Who. I feel like me buying the DVDs would almost be pointless as there would be <em>so many</em> to buy. So I never watched them...</p>

<p>...Until November 2023! So yeah, in 2023 the BBC would allow people (at least in the UK) to watch pre-2005 Doctor Who episodes on their on-demand streaming website, iPlayer. Of course, I'd jump at the opportunity to spend my free time sitting in front of the TV and watching loads of old episodes! In the collection, lives a <em>certain</em> TV special. Yup, we've <em>finally</em> gotten to the main part! Yep, I really sat my butt down and wrote this whole <a href="https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/37">ass-review</a> for a 1996 TV movie - So me. Yass.
		
<p>So, I kind of went into this movie blind. Starting off, <em>Doctor Who</em> (the film) opens up with the Master (who is kind of like the Doctor's frenemy for people who don't know about the lore) being held on trial by the Darleks (although we never see the little Nazi space pepper pots, only their voices), and I don't know, it's kind of strange to me that the Darleks would <em>want</em> to hold a trial, they more seem to me to be the type to just <yell>exterminate</yell> someone rather than putting them on trial -- <em>regardless</em>, the Master is killed, with his last request being that the Doctor (who is still played by Sylvester McCoy at this point) should take his ashes to... someplace... going to be honest, I forgot where it should be <img src="../../emoji/expressions/other/skull.svg" title="Skull emoji (&#x1F480;)." alt="Skull emoji (&#x1F480;)." width="19" height="19">.</p>

<p>But wait! Even though the Master is dead, even in death, his power continues and he causes the Doctor's ship, the TARDIS, to have an emergency stop in 1999 San Francisco. As fate would happen, at the same time this event is occurring, the human Chang Lee (played by Yee Jee Tso) is being hunted by a gang who try to kill him. When they have him cornered, the TARDIS appears when the Doctor leaves his ship, unaware of the danger, and he is gunned down by the members of the gang.</p>

					<figcaption><p>Paul McGann seen here in a publisaty photo as the eighth incarnation of The Doctor, a weird little dude who messages around with time because he's just like that. <em>What a guy!</em></p>
		</figcaption>
		</figure></p>
		
<p>While this murder of the Doctor is fast, I do give credit to the (<em>many</em>) writers of this film for having our favorite Time Lord die in a very... well, I guess unheroic way? Like, it just <em>happens</em>. Regardless, Chang Lee takes the Doctor to a hospital where to skip around a little, thanks to the Doctor not being a human, dies in surgery. Due to this, the dead body of the Doctor is taken to a morgue where he is able to regenerate his body so that it changes so much that he has physically changed into a new body. Now being played by Paul McGann, the Doctor is deeply confused and wanders around the hospital half-naked until he finds new clothing that he steals (hey, Matt Smith's 11th Doctor also steals clothes from a hospital in his first episode!).</p>

	<p>So. That's the start of the film for the most part. Now, what do I, the oh-so-wise Cass, think of these events so far?</p>
	
	<p>Well, to be honest, I kind of wasn't feeling it all that much and felt like something was just... <em>off</em> about the movie so far but I could not put my finger on it. I think my main problem was, well, first of all, it seems to me that the people making <em>Doctor Who</em> took a very uniquely British TV show and packaged it, turning it into something that the nice American viewers at home would enjoy. And Doctor Who just isn't really that, no, it's more of a campy-at-times show that has a lot of soul - and this just doesn't have the soul for me, I'm sorry to say.</p>
	
	<p>I kind of feel like a dick saying that it doesn't have a soul, especially after more than 20 years of people kind of just <em>forgetting</em> about this movie. It would be nice if I was here writing something like &#xAB;Hey readers, check out this cult classic film!&#xBB;. But no, I'm here saying the same stuff people were writing on their GeoCities at the time on Doctor Who fansites.</p>

        <center><img src="gang.png" alt="Cast photo showing Paul McGann, Yee Jee Tso, and Daphne Ashbrook in character by the TARDIS consoles." title="Cast photo showing Paul McGann, Yee Jee Tso, and Daphne Ashbrook in character by the TARDIS consoles."></center>
					<figcaption><p>The Doctor, Chang Lee, and Dr. Grace Holloway are seen in the TARDIS.</p>
		</figcaption>
		</figure></p>
	
	<p>The movie goes on where the Doctor gets together with cardiologist Dr. Grace Holloway (Daphne Ashbrook) (who performed the failed surgery on the Time Lord, despite trying her best) and... uh, guys, I'm not trying to be funny here, but I kind of forgot a fair bit of this film after this point. I remember Chang Lee being able to get into the TARDIS as he stole the Doctor's items from the hospital (that also had the key among other strange and weird things) or whatever and when he entered the ship, somehow the Master was there? How?</p>
	
	<p>Uhhh, the Master, with the help of Chang Lee, opens up this thing in the time machine that will, <em>like</em>, destroy the whole world or something like that so that he can live longer or whatever, uhhh. So to stop him, the Doctor and Grace Holloway need to steal this film's mcguffin, that being this clock thing for <em>some reason</em>.</p>
	
		
<p>When this was all going on, I had food in the oven (some fries), and I put it on to 220Â°C and for some reason, (I think) the oven fan started to make a rattling noise that was really loud and I had to pause the TV to look at it. I don't know what was going on, but I think the fan was broken somehow, anyway, I kind of turned off the oven and then used the oven trays to... well, kinda just hit the back of the oven and that seemed to work (botching at its best!), so that was good. Anyway, I unpaused the film and the Doctor was doing something at a New Year's Eve party but the Master was there and... and anyway, my fries were done, so I put in some chicken now in the oven at 200Â°C and set the alarm. When I came back, the Master was there, as I said, and he was joined by Chang Lee as he <em>somehow</em> persuaded Lee that the Doctor stole <em>his</em> body despite the Master clearly being some evil bastard, like, <em>come on, Chang!</em>  The guy even had green lizard eyes and was all suspect.</p>
		

			<p><figure>
        <center><img src="paul2.png" alt="We see the Doctor in danger as he is locked up in a metal cage." title="We see the Doctor in danger as he is locked up in a metal cage."></center>
					<figcaption><p>Despite locking Paul McGann up in a cage, this movie was still a failure.</p>
		</figcaption>
		</figure></p>

	<p>Anyway, as fate would happen, I didn't hear my alarm go off, so my chicken was kinda dry, but I don't mind all that much as I'm into some weird stuff, like having my stake <em>well done</em>. For real, I love eating it like that. I'm just that kinda gal.</p>
	
<p>But yeah, the chicken and fries were good for the most part - I'm a mayo enjoyer, so I had that on the side. I'm also a fan of tomato sources, but alas, we had none left. Sigh. One thing that I regret about my dinner is that I feel like I added a little <em>too</em> many fries to the point that I was getting tired of eating, oh, woe is me!</p>
	
	<p>Derailing a little back to the movie, once the Doctor gets their hands on the time thing he needs (I have legit kind of forgotten a lot of the plot) he makes it back to his ship with Dr. Grace Holloway, where I think the Master is also there with Chang Lee and he somehow manages to put Holloway under an evil spell and anyway, he locks the Doctor up in some kind of weird device where he can't escape from. The restraining device (as seen on the right) looks kind of weird, but I will give credit to the production team for coming up with something that is so unique, even if it looks a little goofy.</p>
	
	<p>After, the Master tries to use this as a way of taking the Doctor's body, and to cut out even more of the story, he fails and kind of gets eaten up by the TARDIS after a hand-to-hand fight with the Doctor, <strong>but before this</strong>, he manages to not only kill Chang Lee but <strong>also</strong> Grace Holloway.</p>
	
	<p>But don't worry! The Doctor... or the TARDIS (I forgot) somehow managed to bring them both to life, yippee <img src="../../emoji/objects/party/tada.svg" title="Party popper emoji (&#x1F389;)." alt="Party popper emoji (&#x1F389;)." width="19" height="19"> and now everything is fine - <em>The End</em>.</p>
	
	<p><center><strong><span aria-hidden="true">â´</span></strong></center></p>
	
	<p>As of me writing this review, the movie that I am talking about is more than twenty years old and has been <em>more than surpassed</em> in quality by <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/midnight/40.html">a whole new series of Doctor Who</a>, so I think it's fair to say that I am <em>a wee bit late</em> on this review, but look, give me a break, I <em>wasn't even born in 1996!</em> So keep that in mind when I talk about this movie -- writing quality and the way TV is made has changed a lot since the late 20th century.</p>
	
	<p>Saying that, this still sucked for the most part LOL</p>
	
<p><em>Doctor Who: The TV Movie</em> wasn't <strong>meant</strong> to simply be a one-off flick for people to enjoy, no, it was, in fact, meant to be a backdoor TV pilot, where if it was picked up would have moved the show in a whole new direction: An American-produced <em>Doctor Who</em>TV series!</p>
	
<p>I honestly hate to say this, but I see why this was never picked up for a few reasons, first, <em>it was kinda crap</em>. Things in this film just did not mesh well and it made for a kind of unfun-watching experience that it forgettable. I think I'm not going to blame this on the cast, but rather opting to point my grubby finger at the history of the production. You see, this film was in the making for a fair bit of time and was passed around a good amount, with a few scripts being written for it - I really do not feel like this was a good thing for the final product at all. While I am not going to talk about the production history here, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPdFUjAWZNM">this is a good video on the subject</a> - it's a real Â«too many chefs in the kitchenÂ» moment.</p>
	
	<p>Another issue that I think should be addressed is that this just is not a good starting off point for a pilot. If you've never seen Doctor Who before, I really doubt that you will <em>get</em> a lot of what is shown on screen.</p>
	
<p>This takes me back to 2005's <em>Rose</em>. In this episode, it starts with Rose Tyler's average, uninteresting day-to-day life until she is attacked by strange monsters, and is saved at the last second by the Doctor (now played by Christopher Eccleston). Slowly, she learns more and more about this strange man. Someone watching for the first time learns alongside Rose (played by Billie Piper) and will relate to her because of that. But in the movie, we start off with all of this Darlek stuff, the Master, regeneration. Just information overload.</p>
	
	<p>I'm a long-time fan of Doctor Who, so I understood a lot of what I was watching, but trust me, someone who knows next to nothing about the show would be so, so lost here. And that's a great shame, as they will be missing out on a very mid plot and story that has some okay action in it. One of those people who might not have known anything about the show at the time would have been American viewers and, worst of all, the TV exects at the time.</p>
	
	<p>I think when this movie was shown, in the United States of America, <em>Doctor Who</em> was very much still a nerdy and cult thing (don't get me wrong, <em>it's still kinda nerdy here in the UK</em> (or at least it was before Tumblr got their hands on it, but that's another story)) so the idea of just skipping this movie and changing the channel would not be all that strange, I'm sure people would have rather of seen what was on the other station or stick on a DVD than they would to risk wasting their time in watching some weird sci-fi film about a British guy flying through space.</p>
	
	<p>And it shows. This movie only got 5.6 million viewers in the USA. Of course, it did much better in its native Britain, but the BBC wanted more eyes on it than what it got. Due to all of this, I really do not think that the Mighty TV Gods were wrong for not picking this up.</p>
			
<!-- Hoping screen readers don't mess up here -->
<p>It would have been interesting for sure to see what an American Doctor Who would look like, but I'm going to say it here: It would have been <a title="crap" alt="crap" style="text-decoration: none"><span aria-hidden="true">craaaap</span></a>. And probably not in a fun way like how Edd Wood films are so-bad-it's good way. As I said at the start, <em>Doctor Who</em> would be relaunched in 2005 with a whole new Doctor. Since then, the show has done very well for itself. While certainly not <em>always</em> having good episodes, the show has started to make itself very well known in the USA, even having some episodes being set in, or filmed in, the States (Angels Take Manhattan, Hell Bent, Daleks in Manhattan, Rosa (filmed in Cape Town, but set in the USA), and others). Perhaps if the movie with Paul McGann was made nine years later, it would have faired better... umm. Probably not.

					<figcaption><p>After the failor of the 1996 movie, Paul McGann would not play the Time Lord on TV until <em>Night of the Doctor</em> in 2013, although his tenur as the Doctor has seen sucess with audio dramas thanks to Big Finish Productions.</p>
		</figcaption>
		</figure></p>
		<p>Still in our world, Paul McGann would only return to Doctor Who in the form of Big Finish audio dramas (although - get this - the BBC could not use Chang Lee or Dr. Grace Holloway as they didn't have the rights to use them (but the actors who played them also showed up in Big Finish Productions)) and also <em>another</em> TV special, this time with <estrongm>The Night of the Doctor</estrongm>.</p>
		
		<p>In this special, which lasts <strong>only seven minutes</strong> (???), the eighth Doctor meets up with Cass after she sends a distress message after her ship is about to crash - a message that the Doctor picks up. After the Doctor makes his way onto her ship, he is about to get her onto his TARDIS until he lets slip that it's bigger on the inside. At once, Cass realizes that she is talking to a Time Lord - at this point in time for Cass, she is in the middle of The Time War, a war between the Time Lords and the Darleks.</p>
		
		<p>Thanks to this slip, Cass refuses his help. &#xAB;I&#x27;m not part of the war. I swear to you, I never was. [...] Yes, I&#x27;m a Time Lord, but I&#x27;m one of the nice ones&#xBB;. After this, the ship crashes, with only the Doctor being alive, but on the verge of regeneration, only doing so thanks to the Sisterhood of Karn who live on the planet that they crashed on.</p>
		
		<p>And so this takes me to my first review of this short <a href="https://letterboxd.com/dyntylluan/film/doctor-who-the-night-of-the-doctor">that I wrote on Letterboxd</a> (yes, I really <yell>am</yell> reusing my old work, <em>sucks to suck, huh!</em></p>
		
		<blockquote><p>Despite being a very big Doctor Who fan, I somehow missed this at the time.</p>

<p>The plot was a bit confusing - I can't recall who the old women were (I'm not even sure if they were in the main series), also, Emma Campbell-Jones plays someone called Cass (bias alert) and as that is my name, I found it a bit odd that they kept on saying that name a lot.</p>

<p>I wish I could say more, but I feel like Paul McGann didn't really have all that much time to show us what kind of a Doctor he would have been, disregarding the movie. I kind of wish that we could have seen a whole series of the show [starring] McGann now, but oh well.</p>

<p>Overall, it seems to be a very bitter short, but still worth a watch for a Doctor Who fan</p></blockquote>
		
		<p>McGann would be seen on the show again, this time making a cameo in The Power of the Doctor (2022), a story that I haven't seen as it's from the thirteenth Doctor and her series kinda sucked LOL, sorry.</p>
		
		<p>Man, oh, man. This page is getting long, but as Doctor Who is about to reach its 60th birthday, is it time for Paul McGann to have a second chance as the Doctor on TV?</p>
		
	<h1><yell><center>Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes oh yes, please BBC, I'll do anything for Paul to have his own series, please just give him this oh please please please please</center></yell></h1>
		
		<p>I have seen some rumours floating around Doctor Who Twitter<!-- Only calling it X if Elon Musk pays me --> as well as on legit news websites such as Radio Times <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/paul-mcgann-doctor-who-spin-off-series-newsupdate">reporting that he is set to return on a spin-off series</a>. I don't know how likely this is going to be as I feel like the BBC would find it problematic that there would be effectively two Doctor Who's running - that being the Eighth and the Fifteenth Doctors (I am so excited for Ncuti Gatwa, by the way), but who knows? It sure would be nice to see McGann given this, but only the TV Gods at the BBC know for sure. <em>But, here's hoping!</em></p>

<p>As for myself, well, I have over 50 years of Doctor Who stories to keep me busy over the Winter!</p>
