<p>If you thought that Watership Down was depressing and messed up, get read for The Plague Dogs.</p>

<p>I enjoyed how this movie was not shy in what it showed from animal abuse to straight up death of not one, but TWO people. What I also enjoyed was the audio clips of the humans talking over the phone and in parliament, I felt like it really added a whole lot more weight to what was happening to the main cast that could never catch a break.</p>

<p>Much like Watership Down, I have no idea as to why this movie does not have a higher age rating, but oh well, I guess some people like to scare children of the UK.</p>

<p>Well worth a watch if you have not yet done so, personally I made the odd step to watch this movie in the same room as my two dogs, so that was something.</p>
