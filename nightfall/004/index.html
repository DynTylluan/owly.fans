<h3><p>Corrections and Updates</p></h3>
<p>First off, this guy now has a name! He's called Pitt the Bat and was <a href="https://yourdevilfriends.art/">named by devils</a>, so thank you, guys!</p>

<p>Also, if you want to read more about Pitt, please <a href="../../oc/#Pitt, The Evil Bat Boi">check out my OC page where I expanded his lore</a> to be more than just a «furry version of Dracula»!</p>

<p>Another update to this page is changing the links so they no longer show up as the full URL.</p>

The person has on a light-blur tie and a red suit, plus pinkish pants. Blood is dripping from their mouth.

They have long blond hair."></center></p>

<p>After not using MS Paint (or even anything to do with Microsoft) for, God, over five months, I decided that I would draw Xania the Linux fox girl, but it quickly turned into me drawing an almost furry version of Dracula, so I thought what the hell? Let's draw Dracula, after all, they *were* a furry!</p>

<p>I was originally going to only draw this in black, white, and red, but I thought it would be fun if I were to make it so the only colors* that I could use would be the ones found on the ZX Spectrum, a British home computer (the colors that can be used on it are seen on the right).</p>

<p>It's a little funky, but you know what, we need a little funk in our life... or undead life! (wait, are vampires undead??) Can you just imagine someone walking down the street in these colors? My sweet Lord, it would stand out.</p>

<p>As the colors are a little... strange... I welcome you to feel free and edit around this drawing and see if you can make the colors from the ZX work better, or hell, make some art USING the colors, that would be really cool to see!</p>

<p>*I am sorry to my fellow Brits on here, but I use American English online... I have failed you all.</p>
