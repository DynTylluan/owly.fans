<h3>dddd (Second Update)</h3>
		<p>I'm such a silly little sausage (dumbass) - for the <a href="../../accessibility#alt">alt text</a> on the MS Paint drawings, I guess I just <em>forgot</em> to add the correct alt text for them, so instead of them describing the image, screenreaders would read it as «dddd». Amazing.</p>

<h3>Silly Me!</h3>
		<p>When writing this, I forgot to also include the work-in-progress sketch that I used as a reference, so <a href="#The Work In Progress">that has now been added</a>.</p>

		<p>Silly painting that I made that was inspired by a graffiti artist that I've seen around in the West Midlands (UK) called Foxes who draws... well, I'll let you guess! This is the second painting that I've done since I've been an adult, I would show off the first one, but it was a gift <a href="https://mortalsins.neocities.org">for my boyfriend</a>.</p>

<p>Oh dear. Do you want to see something a little naff? Yeah you do, come on now! As I didn't want to just wing it and not know what I was going to draw, I went ahead and made what I wanted to make in MS Paint of all things (MS Paint on Windows <em>XP</em>, mind you). As you can see, the colors are a little different as a whole, like the fox's was going to be this darkish-pinkish color with blue ear tuffs. Yeah, glad that I opted to scrap that idea in favor of the final thing.</p>

		<p>Attached is the poster that was put into the final art. Note that the smiley face has a black outline while the final thing does not. I don't know how I feel about the face being the only thing in the art to not have an outline, but it is what it is.</p>

		<p>Also, I am very aware that these two images look crap. Making anything in XP Paint is legit really hard, even trying to make a circle is almost impossible, so shoutout to people like <a href="https://jimll.co.uk">Jim'll Paint It</a> for <em>somehow</em> becoming a master of this art program. Anyhow, hope you all liked this little bit of fluff. I think in the future, I will also be posting all of the art that I make on my website, and not just <a href="https://sfw.furaffinity.net/user/14jammar">my Fur Affinity account</a> - regardless, see ya around.</p>
