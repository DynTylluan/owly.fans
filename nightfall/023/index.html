		<p>Silly painting that I made that was inspired by a graffiti artist that I've seen around in the West Midlands (UK) called Foxes who draws... well, I'll let you guess! This is the second painting that I've done since I've been an adult, I would show off the first one, but it was a gift <a href="https://mortalsins.neocities.org">for my boyfriend</a>.</p>

Behind that wall is an open field of grass, trees, and flowers.
