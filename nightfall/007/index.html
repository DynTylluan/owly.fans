<h1>Give Pitt a Kiss</h1>
<hr>
		<p>He just wants a kiss!</p>
		<p>Here is some art of my own OC, <a href="https://owlyfans.neocities.org/oc/#Pitt%20The%20Bat">Pitt the Bat</a>, that was made in Pinta and features a trace of my hands, oh my! Thank you to <a href="https://onlinedevil.neocities.org/">Bruno A.</a> for tips on the drawing.</p>

There is blood on his face that has been splattered on. He is saying &#xAB;Give me a kiss!&#xBB;.

His hair is a mess, but at least his nails are polished." width="500" height="500"></center></p>
