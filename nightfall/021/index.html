		<h1>The Only Good Twitter Accounts</h1>
<hr>
		<p>Twitter is a crap website, and you know that, so I thought that I should give a spotlight to some of the only good accounts worth following on there - if you like the OwlyFans website and my work, then you're probably going to also like these accounts, so give them a little look at and even a follow if you want.</p>

<p>And yes, I know it's officially called «X», but I don't care what some billionaire says, it's still called Twitter.</p>

<h3>Corrections and Updates</h3>
		<p>Not sure why, but this Twitter account changed their handle from <tt>DeadTheory_</tt> to <tt>DeadTheory__</tt> (two underlines), so I fixed the broken URL.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">Dead Internet</a> is real and everything has been made by a stupid algorithm that makes you glued to your screens for as long as possible. Until the robots take over and eat us alive, you should enjoy this account that shows you blatant examples of bots posting on Twitter, from replying to popular tweets to paid advertisements on the website clearly not made by a human, this account has you covered. Plus a lot of it can be oddly funny at times.</p>
<p>Also, I swear to Satan if you think my autistic way of writing is robotic and made by an AI then I will scream and bite your head off.</p>

<p>The perfect account does exist and it's this one. Depths of Wikipedia is my lifeblood. This is how I stay young. The Queen drank virgin blood while I browse this Twitter account.</p>
<p>When it comes to it, I think the best way of describing this account is that it's run by a woman who is a bit of a nerd for Wikipedia and is out here posting weird and wonderful findings that she stumbled upon while on the website. So much of this stuff is great to read about and I love just wasting so much of my time seeing what new things have been posted.</p>

<p>Might be now abandoned, but this account owner basically posts jokes that children have come up with, all apparently being genuine. Every post is stupidly funny with how they make little to no sense, with the punchline failing almost every time.</p>

<p>I love taking out my phone at parties (I'm white) and reading these out loud to people, never failing to get others laughing with amusement at how ridiculous these can be.</p>

			<p>Over his lifetime, Louis Wain (1860 - 1939) would make a high number of artworks that would star anthropomorphic cats in human situations.</p>

<p>It's a tragedy that I've not written about Louis Wain yet on this site, so to make up to you lot, please, please, <yell>please</yell> check out this bot account that posts every few hours or so a random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Wain">Louis Wain</a> artwork. This guy was prolific in the cat drawings and paintings that he made over the years, so seeing them all here is so enjoyable. I just love how, even 80 plus years after his death, a Twitter account that reposts his art can get a stupid amount of likes and interactions on old, out-of-copyright art. Like, this account can have over 900 likes on each post - Louis Wain's body may be dead, but people's enjoyment for his work will never die.</p>

<p>Terrible My Little Pony memes straight from 2013. You know when a joke is so terrible that it wraps around to becoming the funniest thing ever? That's this account.
<p>As run by a guy called Tobby, @MLPMemeArchive posts almost on the daily and is kind of nostalgic to me, especially as My Little Pony was the first online fandom that I joined. One extra thing, the person who runs the account also <a href="https://youtube.com/TobbyMLP">has a YouTube channel where they make entertaining videos on topics to do with MLP</a>, so check that ou<span aria-hidden="true">uuu</span>t.</p>

		<p>Sadly killed by Elon being a massive bellend, <em>old roadside pics</em> posted random images taken from <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/roadside-america-photographs">the Library of Congress website that published hundreds of film photos taken by salesman John Margolies</a> from around the 1960s to the 90s of strange roadside attractions that he would pass by. A lot of campy trite here in the best way possible.</p>
<p>What's extra enjoyable about this account is when locals will see a place that they recognize and be like «oh, I know that place! Here are pics of it now».</p>
<p>I kind of wish that there was an equivalent for the UK, but a girl can dream... <yell>Dream like the YouTuber</yell>??</p>
<p>Despite Elon killing this account in 2023, it still lives on thanks to also being on <a href="../../openfight/#Florence of Mastodon">Mastodon</a>, where you can find it still posting away just fine on <a href="https://botsin.space/@oldroadside">@oldroadside@botsin.space</a>.</p>

<p>I love you, weird medieval guys, please never stop posting.</p>
<p>As being one of those best of the public domain accounts, here we have probably one of my favorite Twitter accounts that simply posts strange and unhinged drawings that the account owner, <a href="https://twitter.com/olivia__ms">Olivia Swarthout</a> (<a href="https://nitter.mint.lgbt/olivia__ms">mirror</a>), finds in medieval manuscripts. A simple premise, I know, but done so well.</p>
<p>(Also <a href="https://linktr.ee/weirdmedievalguys">please buy her book</a>, I'm not sponsored but it's really good, I liked it a lot.)</p>

<p>Terrible. All terrible.</p>
<p>One of the only good novelty accounts that hasn't (yet) reposted an OnlyFans model or sold out. Basically, all this account does is post screenshots taken in Minecraft of the worst usernames that I am not that ashamed to admit have made me burst out with laughter many times.</p>

<p>Since 2009... 2009?! Oh wow, but since 2009, this account has been posting snippets from newspapers that are amusing, funny, or just straight-up strange. Worth a look.</p>

<p>Just good art.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Kristoffer Zetterstrand is an artist who deeply needs more recognition outside of Minecraft nerds. Zetterstrand's artwork, in case you didn't know, was used in the Minecraft computer game in the form of in-game paintings that players can hang up on walls. I feel like a lot of people don't understand that computer games can be art, but fortunately, Zetterstrand is proof of this.</p>
<p>A lot of his art, especially his mid-2000s ones, are very inspired by games like Counter-Strike and ones he would have played growing up in the 1980s.</p>
<p>I absolutely love his artwork and am always excited to see what new thing he is working on.</p>
