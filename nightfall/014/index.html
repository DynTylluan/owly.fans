<p>Hey man, first off, thank you very much for making this video, I know that there are a lot of haters in this comment section dismissing this as the type of videos for little babies to look at while their parents are screwing in the next room over or doing something like sleeping on the sofa, but I am a full adult here saying that I loved this! I think you should carry on making these videos, perhaps longer? That would be great.</p>

<p>Man, I love doing an unholy amount of acid and just sitting down and watching this on loop. I showed this to one of my straight friends (I'm okay with straight people as long as they don't push their lifestyle on other people, but anyway) he said that I was a wanker for liking this. IDK what his issue is, anyway, I decided to spike his drink with pure LSD when we were at the local pub, and <yell>Man</yell>, did he change his mind after that, I'll tell you. He loved this and is even a new follower of your family-friendly YouTube channel.</p>

<p>I think the next thing to do is that I should try poppers to this, man, those things are WILD, I love to sniff them, uh, I mean... I love to clean my videotape head cleaner with them... yeah, anyway, I bet sniffing poppers to «Choose food challenge <img src="../../emoji/expressions/smileys/happy_fun/joy.svg" title="Face with tears of joy emoji (&#x1F602;)." alt="Face with tears of joy emoji (&#x1F602;)." width="19" height="19"> A piece of watermelon or a chocolate egg? <img src="../../emoji/expressions/smileys/sarcasm_unamused/rolling_eyes.svg" title="Face with rolling eyes emoji (&#x1F644;)." alt="Face with rolling eyes emoji (&#x1F644;)." width="19" height="19">

	<p><yell>Anyhow</yell>, this is just a long way of saying thank you for the great #content and that you should keep it up and not be ashamed of the type of videos that you make, man, I know if I were in your place, I would *not* want stuff like this to show up on résumé! But that's what makes you guys so cool, you don't care what other people say or care, you do your own thing, and good for you, even if your thing is brain-rotting and makes me cringe that children will grow up with stuff like this, man, I wish when I was growing up, I got to watch stuff like this rather than, oh I don't know, programs on TV that also made me learn stuff at the same time, crazy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'll be going now as my straight friend wants to chop off my arm for stealing over 58% of his pure snow #BritishMade</p>
