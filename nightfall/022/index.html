		<h1>(Shameless Plug Time) Read My New Blog!</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hello there readers, well, guess what time it is? It's the time of the year when I, Cass, start a new blog/part of my website that I'll update once and never touch again, yay - except this time, I have pre-written a good amount of stuff for it!</p>

<p>Okay, we're jumping around too much here, but basically, <em>this</em> page is just an advert for a new thing I have on my website that I worked hard on, that being <a href="../../doom/history">Doom: Rediscovering History</a>, where I'll write about weird, terrible, and what I find to be interesting Doom mods that you, our dear reader, might enjoy learning about - oh my!</p>

<p>I don't have much to talk about regarding the new format that I'm doing, but if you like this blog and my work, you're also going to enjoy what I have written. Right now, I have published three articles on there, the first, rather fittingly, is about <a href="../../doom/history/001">the first ever Doom mod, Origwad</a>. The next is about <a href="../../doom/history/002">Marine Doom</a>, a mod that was made by the US Marine Corps as a way to train soldiers, and finally, <a href="../../doom/history/003">we have a page on Kick Attack!</a>, used as a way to sell soft drinks.</p>

<p>I have a lot planned for this new part of my website, like pages talking about infamous mods and the like, so feel free to check out Doom: Rediscovering History!</p>
