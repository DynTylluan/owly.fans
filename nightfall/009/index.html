		<p>Hello all, hope you're having a good December, if you're from the future, I hope you're having a terrible time <img src="../emoji/expressions/smileys/cats/blep.svg" title="Mutant Standard Emoji showing a happy cat face." alt="Mutant Standard Emoji showing a happy cat face." width="19" height="19"> Ah ha haa, just joking, you're... mostly cool.</p>
		
		<p>So, what is this all about? Wasn't <a href="/nightfall/008/" title="Link to «Neocities Drama: What We Know»." alt="Link to «Neocities Drama: What We Know».">the last blog post a massive piss-take?</a>, Why, yes it was, I like how you're a fast learner here, but this blog is <em>also</em> used to show off my... great art, such as this one that's of my wife, Xenia. Sorry, I mean «<em>waifu</em>». <a href="xenia_art_og.png">The original was 128x128</a> and I intend to make it into a Minecraft map art (still working on that), so in the meantime, here's yet <em><a href="https://furaffinity.net/gallery/14jammar/folder/1049859" title="Link leads to my Fur Affinity gallery on Xenia." alt="Link leads to my Fur Affinity gallery on Xenia.">another</a></em> fanart from me of the Linux fox girl - yipee</p>			

<p><center><img src="xenia_art.png" alt="Behind the trans pride flag, we see Xenia, who is an anthro foxgirl with red and white fur. She has round glasses and is smiling. She has a t-shirt that says «Linux» on. Her blonde hair is tied up with a red hairband.

Next to her is a purple love heart." title="Behind the trans pride flag, we see Xenia, who is an anthro foxgirl with red and white fur. She has round glasses and is smiling. She has a t-shirt that says «Linux» on. Her blonde hair is tied up with a red hairband.
