<p>As sung by ???, this is the opaning track for the Hazbin Hotel poilet. For the firts song, yeah, it's a good one for the most part, if not a little... boring, I guess around the middle of it, but it's a fine start, plus it's the only song on this list that is a cover. Also, with the theming of the charater who is singing, Charlie, the vocals are quite sweet sounding and can be real good.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a good cover and a very <em>okay</em> start to the poilet for the show, but isn't anything amazing or groundbreaking, plus others have made better covers of it throughtout the years. I think the main reason why it's so low on this list is just becasue I find it so boring and I don't think it offers me anything new in terms of music.</p>


<h3>Inside of Every Demon</h3>
<p>I really feel mean for putting this song so low as it is one of the first times (or <em>the first</em>?) that we hear in Hazbin Hotel that is an orignal Vivzipop song, and while it has a lot of fun parts to it, I just feel like this song is nothing more than a nothingburger and isn't all that fun to play to myself. If I heard this on the radio, I would flip to another station.</p>
<p>If it means anything, I like certan parts to the music video for this song, like how Charlie goes full demon for a good few seconds is cool, for sure, but as I said, I just don't care all that much for this song, I just don't think it's all that amazing.</p>
	

<h3>Addict</h3>
<p>Despite being a fan of Vivz and her work, I never <em>actally</em> liserned to this song at the time and only watched it now thanks to this listing. <em>Addict</em> itself is a stand-alone music video that stars Angel Dust and Cherry Bomb. The lyrics and the backing track of this are so damn 2010s, it's crazy. I feel like I have a very love-hate relationship with this song as a whole - sure there are some good parts, but others are just kind of naff. With that said, I do like the singing for what it's worth, but overall, this sounds like something I would have heard on the radio about a decade ago.</p>

		<h3>Teacher's song</h3>
		<p>A cute little song to start off the first real episode of Helluva Boss - not amazing, not terrible, just okay.</p>
		
		<h3>My World Is Burning Down Around Me</h3>
		<p>Eh. We don't really hear much from this song, but the lyrics are funny in an ironic way, so there's that, but as I said, we don't get to know this one all that much, so I don't know what else I can <em>really say</em>.</p>
		
		<h3>I.M.P Jingle</h3>
		<p>It's a throwaway song that is cut off short in the poilet episode of Helluva Boss, but I honestly have had this stupid song stuck in my head at times, and you know what? I kinda like it.</p>
		
		
		<h3>C.H.E.R.U.B Jingle</h3>
		<p>Sorry, screenreader!</p>
		<p>Just a cathy tune that I have legit sang to myself while I have been at work, so clearly the Helluva Boss team where doing <em>something</em> right with this.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Respectless</h3>
		<p>I'm that #bitch</p>
		<p>Okay, look, this might seem really stupid, but I kind of have a thing where I sometimes just do not like British voices, despite being a Brit myself. This song is just naff, but I like how bitchy the lyrics are.</p>

		<h3>Welcome To Heaven</h3>
		<p>I just don't care about this all that much, sorry my little bitches.<p>
		
		<h3>More Than Anything</h3>
		<p>I just don't care about this all that much, sorry my little bitches.<p>
		
		<h3>You Didn't Know</h3>
		<p>I just don't care about this all that much, sorry my little bitches.<p>
		
		<h3>Out For Love</h3>
		<p>Yeah, it's a very okay song, nothing else can be added to that.</p>
		
		<h3>Monster's Ball</h3>
		<p>I don't remember this one, but it seems good for the most part. I like the drumming and the overall insamentals of this track, like <em>Cotten Candy</em>, this one is very early 2010s sounding.</p>
		
		<h3>Whatcha Thinkin' About</h3>
		<p>It's cute, but we really don't hear much from it, so I'm just unsure.</p>
		
<h3>Inside of Every Demon (Reprisal)</h3>
<p>Out of the three songs from the poilet, this is the strongiest for sure. I just love the 1920's-era style of it, despite how short of a track it really is (less than a minuet). I don't know, I guess I have a certan fondness for broughtvill songs, and this one will be stuck in my head forever, so good work to ??? for singing this one.</p>

		
		<h3>Mustang Dong</h3>
		<p><yell>I love this song!!</yell></p>
		<p>A stupid song that always make em laught, I just love the over-the-top 1908s style of this one, plus the lyrics are super stupid that I just adore it.</p>
		
		<h3>Chaz Time</h3>
		<p>Such a stupid song from a creepy weirdo that I love a little <em>too much</em>. I can't play this without smiling at myself like an idiot.</p>
		
		<h3>Vacay to Bonetown</h3>
		<p>I feel like I should like this song a whole lot more as the lyrics are quite fun and the singing is nice, but I don't know, I just feel like it's kind of too boring and slow for me to care all that much from it, oddly enouth, I think I like <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kxpst2A7bPA">the demo track for this one</a> a whole lot more.</p>
		
		<h3>Loo Loo Land Theme</h3>
		<p>An example of why having Alex Brightman on your team just makes what should be an annoying and repetative song a fun and catchy little tune.</p>
		
		<h3>Everybody Look At Me!</h3>
		<p>Rather short one here, but I love hearing Moxxie sing, plus the <yell>Epic Banjo Solo</yell> was a lot of fun.</p>
		
		<h3>Sweet Victory</h3>
		<p>And Moxxie can go fuck himself</p>
		
		<h3>Crashin' a Muthaf**kin' Wedding</h3>
		<p>Very good, very very good. It's great to hear something that I could imagin could also have been from a Hollywood movie. Just talent.</p>
		
		<h3>You Got The Power (Millie's Big Show)</h3>
		<p>I love over the top 80s bangers like this, so that's why it's so high. It's dumb, the lurics don't make sense half of the time, and the music video for it shows the main charaters on drugs. It fucks.</p>
		
		<h3>Stolas's Song</h3>
		<p>Get better hoes, Stolas</p>
		
		<h3>Til the day we die</h3>
		<p>Need a bad bitch like <script type="text/javascript">
var images = [
'Moxxie',
'Millie',
]
document.write(images[Math.floor(Math.random() * images.length)]);
			</script> in my life, just sayin'.</p>
		<p>Very sweet little tune that I feel like not many people care about, but I liked it, plus hearing M&amp;M singing is always sweet as I legit thinkt hat they are such a nice cupple.</p>
		
		<h3>Regular Joe</h3>
		<p>Yet another silly song that I feel like people don't care all that <em>much</em> about, but I thought it was fun. <yell>They keep sending you <em>what?!</em></yell></p>
		
		<h3>Happy Day In Hell</h3>
		<p>Bisexuals are crazy, man.</p>
			

<h3>Oh Millie</h3>
<p>When arceologiests look back at the 2020s, they'll relize just how hard it was to be bisexual cuz both Moxxie and Millie are cute as fuck.</p>
<p>I don't really have all that much <em>to say</em> about this song as a whole, but I can sometimes be a real sucker for the more romatic sides of songs, and this is just a perfect example of one. Sweet, simple, cute - I just love it.</p>

		
		<h3>Whatever It Takes</h3>
		<p>It's good, just not amazing.</p>
		<p>I like how the two singer's voices mix togehter at times, but honestly, I <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=cDB9GR-wGYA">like this cover more</a>.</p>

<h3>Juggling Iz Cool</h3>
<p>This might be the weakiest song from the <em><yell>Mammon's Magnificent Musical Mid-season Special (Ft Fizzarolli)</yell></em> episode of the show, and that is saying a lot. With that said, all of the songs from there are just solid tracks, including this one that is just Tom Cardy at his best. Great song with an amazing backing track. Good shit, just wish it was longer.</p>


<h3>2 Minutes Notice</h3>
<p>I feel like this is a bit of a fan faviurot, but I just don't care for it. I know it's <em>good</em>, but I just don't care for it all that much - sorry! With that saying, the mid-section of the song is a lot of fun and really makes it for me.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Just Look My Way</h3>
		<p>There's something about Stolas and him sounding like his songs shouls be from a rock ballat. If this was from an album, then the next song would be the best ever metal song ever. I never saw this at the time, so that's my bad.</p>
		
		<h3>Hell Is Forever</h3>
		<p>This song is just a masive f-off to Charlie and I love it, but not as much as I love Alex Brightman's singing voice, oh, and look who also had a part in the song, it's Sam Haft who has also written songs for Helluva. No wonder it's so good.</p>
			
		
		<h3>Stayed Gone</h3>
		<p>The girls are fighting, agian.</p>
			
		
<h3>Cotton Candy</h3>
		<p>

<p>I honestly don't know if I want to say all that much about this song and I think it's just very... okay. Like, it's not the next big thing since the last big thing, it's just a very radio-friendly sounding song that repeats itself a lot to the point that I wanted to hear something else. It just stays its welcome.</p>
		
		<p>I liked the &#xAB;Let them eat cake, let them eat pie&#xBB; line, however, and yes, this song will be stuck in my head forever and ever.</p>
		
<h3>House Of Asmodeus</h3>
<p>Okay Internet dwells, this is some good shit right here.</p>
<p>As starting off with a solo from Moxxie, who is singing a simple song about his love for his wife, Millie, the song quickly evolves into a complex banger that makes use of Asmodeus himself in what I can only decirbe as something that would come from a more wild <a href="../../nb21/000a/#Swing%20You%20Sinners!%20(1930)">cartoon from Fleischer Studios</a>.</p>
		<p>In the song, we also hear from Fizzarolli, althought he's more of a backing singer to Asmodeus, who really takes the main stage. In the song, there's also a <em>second</em> mini-song when suddaly Verosika is the focas of the track in what I can only think is a soft-rock like tune. Verosika as a singer is underrated in Helluva Boss and I feel like we're really missing out on some action from her.</p>
		
		<p>Overall, this is a great track that really shows me the progression of the show and how it has changed for the better.</p>

		
		<h3>Look At This</h3>
		<p>Alex Brightman has really been a net-posative when it comes to him being in most anything he is in, and him playing Fizzarolli is no exception. This guy is the real deal when it comes to talent, and it bloody well shows in this song that it all over the place in the best way. From the somber opaning that suddaly moves to a stupidly upbeat tune, then it goes all techno <yell>Then It Goes</yell> in an almost metal song?? This shit fucks.</p>
		
		<h3>The Ballad of Striker</h3>
		<p>I'm a sucker for Western music like this, so it's no shcoker that this song is so high up this list. Love bad guy songs, you go, Striker.</p>

		<h3>Moxxie's Bad Trip</h3>
		<p>Honestly, hats off to Sam Haft for writing this song. God, just everything about this screams talent - from the visuals of the acompaning music video, to the intaments, to the singing. Just amazing work here that somehow magaes to merge rather-theatre-sounding music with ...progressive rock? Not sure what kind of style the second part is, but I like it a lot (but not as much as Moxxie's theatre song).</p>
		
		<p>My only issue with this song is that Moxxie's singing can be a wee bit iffy at times, but I honesly feel like I can look past this as eveything is just so steller.</p>
		<p>In other words, if I was a Gen Zer I would have written something like &#xAB;viv do be cooking!!&#xBB;.</p>
	
		
		<h3>Hell's Greatest Dad</h3>
		<p>Daddy issues are wild. Once agian, this is a song that is all over the place in the best way possible that I love. Just the two singers going at it is really funny, making this a top tire song.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Loser, Baby</h3>
		<p>Habin Hotel really brought out the big guns when it comes to the songs in the show, and this is 100% an exmaple of that for sure. Love both of the singers and the instruments fuck.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Crooked</h3>
		<p>The singing talent of James Monroe Iglehart and Alex Brightman is on full despy wiht this one. It's sad, cute, romatic, and funny at times.</p>
		<p>I seem to have a thing for songs that are complex in their backing tracks, but this one is so so simple, with just a guitar taking the center stage in this track, this just allows Iglehart and Brightman's singing just stand out even more.</p>
		<p>Perfect track, love it.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Poison</h3>
		<p>Good, it's very good.</p>
		<p>This is yet another song that I am conflicted on as it's just too good and I don't know if it's better than bangers like <em>Klown B*tch</em>. The backing track is top tire, but what just makes it so fucking good is Blake Roman's talent. Honestly, I just feel like Roman is an amazing voice acter <em>and</em> such a great singer, as you might be able to tell with how many of his songs are so high on this page.</p>
			
		
		<h3>Klown B*tch</h3>
		<p>Yeah, this song just fucks. God, I have only good things to say about it - Sam Haft's talent in making this song really shows and Haft was such an underated asset when it comes to Helluva Boss as a whole.</p>
		<p>This song was stuck in my head <em>for weeks</em>, it certally did not help that I downloaded it onto my computer, effectivly looping it. Viv, I am begging you, please release a longer version of the song, <yell>please</yell>!</p>
		<p>By the way, <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QaBGjFRVKkY">the dmeo for this</a> is 100% worth a play.</p>
		
		
		<h3>You Will Be Okay</h3>
		<p>God, this list broke me. I legit did not know what song I liked more; this one or Moxxie's Bad Trip, but this one <em>just</em> won by an <em>inch</em>.</p>
		<p><em>You Will Be Okay</em> as a song isn't complex, the backing track is very all that amazing, and third thing, but this song <em>really fucking</em> makes up in not only the amazing singing that almost makes it soud like a rock ballad, but the lyrics that just hit so hard. Bascally they boil down to &#xAB;your mom is a bitch, I'm going to die one day, but I love you so, so much&#xBB;. God damn, just amazing craftmanship was made for this song.</p>
		<p>No notes needed on this, <em>You Will Be Okay</em> is just a perfect ten out of ten song from start to finish.</p>
