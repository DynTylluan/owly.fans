	<p><strong>Yes, that's right... I said it, NFTs <yell>suck</yell>, are <em>stupid</em>, <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?tech=nft">and are scams</a></strong> (oh, also <a href="#*">*</a>women don't find the idea of it all that hot).</p>

	<h3>People who buy into NFTs are morons and we all know it! &#xAB;Hmmm, oh yes, I sure love paying ten billion DollarPounds for <a href="https://gordongoner.com">this computer image of a dumb monkey</a>, oh yes, this will be worth a lot!&#xBB; <em>Huh???</em> Have you tried to <yell>hire</yell> someone to make your art?

	<p>And here I thought the idea of art was to express yourself??</p>
	
	<p>Oh, you are so smart to invest in Daddy Derek's 420-themed NFTs (<font color="green"><strong>Light 'em up! Make Pot Legal!</strong></font>), please meet me at the local bar in town, sit down at my table, and tell me <em>all about</em> your future roadmap while my t-girl bussy is leaking. I am but the little doge dog next to you with the tiny, smooth brain going goo goo ga ga. Here I was, paying artists to draw me crap I can hang up on my wall that I forgot... the <em>real</em> magic in art isn't anything stupid like creative freedom, but it's paying some scammer to get a computer to go <tt><yell><strong><font color="gray">beep boop, here is CumShitWank NFT #69420Reddit</font></strong></yell></tt>.

	<p>I'm sorry, but what kind of caveman brain motherfliper looks at their crusty computer screen and goes &#xAB;Unf. Me make big money out of this!

Why don't you go to your local park? Have you gone to a museum, you know, I heard that they have these funny pictures on the walls that show NFTs but you can't be scammed by them and you actually have to appreciate them rather than use them as a made-up ogga booga brain currency. <em>Elon isn't going to buy you a house, a car, or invest in your dumb monkey!</em></p>

	<p>Some artist on DeviantArt just died and I'm low on cash after buying into a scam after I saw on my Twitter that if I give one bitcoin (equal to 27,089.90 USD), then I will be given back sixteen bitcoins, jeez, thanks, Daddy Elon, so now what I'm gonna do is download their images off DeviantArt and sell them, pretending that I'm their fuckin' family or whatever, simple! Eazy! No-one cares if you freeload off of other people, why would they? It's the Wild West, and we're all Jesse James</p>
	
	<p>All my Twitter frens love NFT so it will be okay to do that. People love NFTs, just look at this Wired article:</p>

    </blockquote></p>
	
	<p>Um. Yeah, fucking thanks. It's not like I could have used my cell phone to take a photo of some graffiti and upload it online to my social feed or even my own website (making websites is hard, so I just use Wix.com).</p>

<p>Seriously, I know that I'm going to sound like a boomer here, but I have a hobby of using a disposable camera and using that to take photos of street art, then scanning in the photos onto my computer and showing the results to people, just do that, it's fun.</p>
	
	<h1><strong><yell>This is an NFT update</yell></strong></h1>

<h1>But Cass (that's me, I'm the sysop and am really cool)... why Did You Make This Page??</h1>
<p>idk</p>
<p>Well, okay, I made this page so I could 1) make fun of techbros and 2) make fun of OWLyFans, «<em>huh, but I don't</em>», oh, this is you BTW if you're a techbro who likes NFTs (I'm owning you) «<em>But I don't get it?? This website <yell>is</em> OwlyFans??</em>» <yell>no you stupid moron, can you not reed <!-- Not an error - do not correct -->? This is <strong>O</strong>wly<strong>F</strong>ans, while the other is <strong>OWL</strong>y<strong>F</strong>ans. Doofus.</p>

<p>This <font color="green">Chad big t-girl penis</font> <a alt="This was when the domain of owly.fans was bought" title="This was when the domain of owly.fans was bought">website was started in 2021</a> while the <font color="blue">virgin little loser</font> NFT project was started at <a alt="This was when the Twitter handle of @ETOWLS was made" title="This was when the Twitter handle of @ETOWLS was made">least in February 2023</a>. We share a name but not a world view. Anyway, seeing that they share a name with us, let's see what their about me says:</a>

<blockquote><p>Are you tired of all those ordinary lucky charms? Well, it&#x27;s time to upgrade and join the world of OWLyFans! Prepare yourself to have your life to get endless doses of owl-tastic luck &#x26; happiness. Who needs clovers when you can have the wise guidance of an owl!</p>

<p>Owning an OWLyFans NFT not only brings good luck but also transforms you into the epitome of coolness. Picture yourself strolling through life surrounded by envious people who know you&#x27;re on the cutting edge of luck trends.</p></blockquote>


<p>Is it corny to say that I just got chills down the back of my spine... because dude... <em>I just got chills down my back!</em>... I don't know about you, but I think I wanna see what these NFTs look like.</p>

Did you use that and just made an AI spit out loads of images that you then slapped onto OpenSea?</p>

		</figcaption>
    </figure></p>

<p>First off, why would I want to own something that looks like it was made by an AI? Doesn't it defeat the whole point in owning something unique if it looks almost the same as the other set of NFTs sold by the seller? My God, this looks so terrible and I don't see why anyone would want to spend any of their money on your crap when it would be better off spent on doing something good like,,, <yell>like anything else!</yell></p>

<p>I will say this, our namesake's NFTs are at least cheap, being around $2.30, but still, I think I'd rather spend that money on something better, admitally, you can't buy that much with that cost, but you know what else is cheaper? Going onto <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">www dot google dot com</a> and typing in &#xAB;<font color="blue"><yell>make AI image</yell></font>&#xBB;, going onto that website, typing out &#xAB;<tt>cute owl sitting on branch</tt>&#xBB;, waiting, and then <em>Boom!</em> you've got an image that looks like one of these shitty owls. Of course, I'm not <em>saying</em> that's what <strong>OWL</strong>y<strong>F</strong>ans NFT did, I'm just saying that the art style looks quite simaler to something an AI would make - I'm sure <strong>OWL</strong>y<strong>F</strong>ans made the art on their own!</p>

<p>But for real, <strong>OWL</strong>y<strong>F</strong>ans NFT project leader, if you're reading this, then lol, I own <a href="https://owly.fans">owly dot fans</a> lol and that's a really funny website domain name that I am sending this to my girlfriend (she's real and also vapes and smokes w<yell>ee</yell>d) and she said that it's really funny and also said if I wanted to have e-sex later on (she said I could be the one being vored this time - yippee!!) Oh, also my dad just called to say that he loves me and the Prime Minaster also phoned me to tell me that I am really funny (I told him to fuck off as he's Tory scum).</p>

<p><h1><center><yell>Anyway!</yell></center></h1></p>

<center><p><h2><yell>Enough about this <strong>OWL</strong>y<strong>F</strong>ans NFT loser</yell></h2></p></center>

<h3><em><p>Let's talk about other terrible NFT projects that I want to dunk on</p></em></h3>

<p>NFTs are terrible things, and <em>The Gypsy</em> is proof of that, I have very little words to fully describe how ... dogshit(?) these look, like yeah, I would <yell>really</yell> love to own one of <em>these</em> bad boys, mmm, oh yes baby! Anyway, the cat is out of the bag here as if you look down, you'll see what these NFTs look like:</p>

<p><center><img src="gypsy.png" alt="A collection of poorly drawn images of people's faces." title="A collection of poorly drawn images of people's faces."></center></p>

<p><em>Well, at least this time it doesn't look like a computer made these...</em></p>

<p>Top left we have &#xAB;The Gypsy (Pro Vladimir Putin)&#xBB;, next to it we have &#xAB;The Gypsy Four&#xBB;, bottom left it's &#xAB;The Gypsy Five&#xBB;, and, finally, &#xAB;The Gypsy (Pro Volodymyr Zelenskyy)&#xBB;. Oh how brave you are for supporting Ukraine <yell>and</yell> Russia. You know, during the War in Ukraine, I truly think that Russia is the victim here, they just want to stop the Nazis in Ukraine by... killing.... killing civilians and committing war crimes...? Wait, that doesn't sound right... I guess this is the only way to &#xAB;demilitarise and denazify&#xBB; Ukraine!</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm saying this as a way to piss off the Putin simps lol <strong><font color="#005BBB">Slava Ukraïni</font>!</strong></p>

<p>I really wish that I had more to say about this collection of ass, but I really don't. I just think that this is either a guy who just relized that there's, somehow, money to be made in NFTs and was like &#xAB;<yell><font color="green">Oh shit! I need to make some moola!</font></yell>&#xBB; <em>or</em> was made by someone who thought &#xAB;<font color="purple">Hmmm, if I put no effort into this, then people will want to buy it as a form of irony!</font>&#xBB;. Anyway, no-one cares about Gypsy NFTs <img src="../emoji/expressions/hands/hmn/thumbs_up_hmn.svg" title="Thumbs up emoji (&#x1F44D;)." alt="Thumbs up emoji (&#x1F44D;)." width="19" height="19"></p>


<p>Oh, what's this? It looks like we have a newsflash...</p>

	<h1><strong><yell><p>NFT Update</p></yell></strong></h1>
	<p>This just in, my fellow frens, welcome to NFT News with your host, DJ OwlGal AKA Cass. What's up, forum? Hello? We're just gotten an update on the Elon Musk situation... Only a few hours ago, Elon Musk posted a tweet where he talked about ShitPenis NFTs and their price, causing the cost of the NFTs to go up in price, making shareholders very rich and sexy, <yell>but only now</yell> did Elon post this tweet:</p>

			<center><p><img src="elon2.png" alt="Fake Elon Musk tweet: yeah, shitpenis seem like a scam, I don't think I'd invest in NFTs anytime soon..." title="Fake Elon Musk tweet: yeah, shitpenis seem like a scam, I don't think I'd invest in NFTs anytime soon..."></p></center>
			
			<p>Yes, that's right. Due to this, the price of ShitPenis has fallen to less than a cent, making Robux worth more!</p>

<p>The long and short of this page? Uhh, uh, don't get scammed!</p>
