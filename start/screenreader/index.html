<p><strong><font color="#A3A29A">The Start</font></strong></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Did you see that? Look, it's them. Look down and see.</font></p>
	
<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> What are you looking at? <em>The Reader</em>?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Yes, look what they did...</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> They seem so small compared to us... so powerless... so insignificant...</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> But yet,</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> But yet they did it... they killed the Pendragon. An ant... an ant killed her. A small insignificant ant killed her.</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> They may be small, but powerless? Insignificant? They shaped the world with their hands, they made tools, and killed the Pandragon. <em>The Reader</em> is anything but worthless.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> But they are an ant compared to us; we could crush them with just one hoof. They don't even know that we have been watching, they know nothing of us.</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> I care not; They have shown me that they are like us in many ways; they have built homes, they made alliances. Friendships were made. And friendships were lost... over time.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> They... They can be like us, yes. But we created their land, we shaped it in seconds, they can only change it over hours... days, months, years even.</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> I know, but I only care about what they have done - their own power and mite, however.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> Look, <em>[Unintelligible]</em>, it looks so cold where they are...</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> They are. The cold air feels like razors over their skin, but they should care not after their victory.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> But what's the point?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> The point?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e">Inside the powercage of their mind, they know only a small slither of what we know, but they are unstoppable, but outside, they are weak and powerless. This did not stop <em>The Reader</em>. They live to prove.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> What do you mean?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> They live to prove something; that they can show the world that they are strong, in their mind. <em>The Reader</em> made the world their own, they proved their mite, <em>The Reader</em> lives to make the world a better place.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> But why?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Why? <em>The Reader</em> is love</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> <em>The Reader</em> is love?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Aye, they are, but they need to be loved by others to be happy, and intern, they need to show that same love to others.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> Are you sure they are love?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> I think so, but <em>The Reader</em> is also anger and rage and fear. But that's okay.</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e">It is okay... but why? Because it proves to me that they are something that we can never be</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> ...human?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Human. Correct. Despite being <em>[Unintelligible]</em>, we will never know what it is like to be them.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> Perhaps that is why I have my doubts about them... they are human... they have flaws</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981">And I guess in some way... I wish I was like that, having flaws, that is to say</font></p>

<p><font color="#A3A29A"><strong>Cass:</strong> They both stopped talking. Hundreds of thoughts began to fill their mind of what it would be like to suddenly become a human. It was strange and almost upset the two, but they could not control what they were thinking of.</font></p>
		
<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> If I could, I wish I could fall in love for the first time</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> What do you think falling in love is like?</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> I don't know. I wish I knew, oh good <em>[Unintelligible]</em>, I wish I could tell you what it must be like to be young and just... see someone, see someone that you know that you cannot live without... that you want to...</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981">to just kiss?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Yes. I wish I knew what it was like to know pure anger, too... I wish I could hate my brothers, sisters, and siblings...</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> Anger must feel good</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Anger must.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> I want to know what it's like to scream, I want to know the feeling <em>The Reader</em> would feel when someone hurts them and makes them sad</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981">Good <em>[Unintelligible]</em>, I want to know</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981">I want to just, hate. See someone that you know you could hurt, just thinking about them makes you mad</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> I would do anything</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> Sadness is another one</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> I don't understand sadness</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> It confuses me, I see players below getting... upset when someone dies</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> People die all of the time</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> People do</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> That confuses me, why don't they get upset then?</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> I wish I could say.</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> But look at them, look at <em>The Reader</em> now.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> I think <em>The Reader</em> is smarter than we let on</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Do you think?</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> I was a fool saying that, they are smart</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Yes?</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> Can they read us...</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981">Can they can read our thoughts..?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Perhaps so</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> Did you already know?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> I had my suspicions</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e">But I had no concerns, they only did this in their sleep, thinking it was only dreams, but when they awoke, they soon forgot and moved on.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> But this is not a dream for them</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> This is not, they used to dream in black and white, but now they can dream in all of the hues of the rainbow.</font></p>

<p><font color="#A3A29A"><strong>Cass:</strong> The two gods looked down at <em>The Reader</em>. They were looking at stars while in a field of wheat. The world that they were in was still strange to see, it was full of monsters, but you are the Pendragon now. The Pendragon of A Thousand Enemies - when your foes see you, they will try and catch you, and whenever they catch you, they will kill you.</font></p>

<p><font color="#A3A29A">But first, they must catch you, Pendragon.</font></p>

<p><font color="#A3A29A">But you are fast, you are smart, cunning and full of tricks - because of this, your people... your allies... will never be destroyed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#A3A29A">The gods looking down knew this.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> But what's next for <em>The Reader</em>?</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> I don't know</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e">It's their move next, we should not interfere with the lives of mortals</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> They can build more, explore</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981">Kill, seek and destroy</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Murder.</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e">Make friends, get rich in that friendship</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> But one thing that I hope they don't do is stop making allies</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> No, that would be the worst action</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> Everyone needs friends, <em>[Unintelligible]</em> - we are not as powerful without them by our side. <em>The Reader</em> should go outside and seek the aid of others when they are sad, and reach out when they are ill. Only a true friend can help others when they are at their lowest point.</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Friendship is something that all intelligent life will always need, no matter where you are from, no matter what language you speak. Getting up and seeing many new worlds, some generated by code, others not.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> Inside the powercage of their mind, so much must be going through it right now, but one thing that I hope they will never forget is that even in their darkest hour, people will always love them - they need to remember that until the day they die.</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> Because they are love and that is beautiful.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> In the end, they may only see a small part of the world and meet a fraction of players, but <em>The Reader</em> should be proud of what they have done, even if it was on their own, I am content in saying that <em>The Reader</em> has done amazing work with the cards that they were dealt.</font></p>

<p><font color="#A3A29A"><strong>Cass:</strong> Watching <em>The Reader</em>, the two looked on, unblinking. It was hard to describe exactly what either of them looked like, even counting the number of eyes they had was hard. They had hooves, that was for sure, but they also had quite human hands and perhaps even the head of a goat with long horns, or not, but looking at either was not easy... looking was like trying to see the rainbow when you were blind.</p>

<p><em>[Unintelligible]</em> had been watching for hours, talking about things that were almost impossible to imagine... they talked about things the <em>The Reader</em> would not be able to even picture, but there was a trade-off - they were both unable to do anything that <em>The Reader</em> could do, they could, in fact, not achieve anything on the bear scale of what was done by <em>The Reader</em>.</p>

<p>They were both able to decide on the way that the world looked like, but once <em>The Reader</em> looked at what was made, <em>[Unintelligible]</em> powers became null.</p>

<p><font color="#A3A29A">Both of them looked at the other.</font></p>

<p><font color="#545c7e"><strong>God One:</strong> I hope this isn't the end for <em>The Reader</em>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#c56981"><strong>God Two:</strong> The sun will rise tomorrow and this is only the start.</font></p>
