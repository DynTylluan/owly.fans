<!--
The CSS on this page was written by Mozilla for Firefox. The text was written by...
- Mozilla with «The Book of Mozilla»
- Flock browser team with «The Book of Mozilla, 11:1»
- Iceweasel team with «The Book of Ice»
- Cass «Owly» Python with «The Book of Night»
- «The Book of SeaMonkey» was taken from the SeaMonkey browser and is almost a one-to-one of «The Book of Mozilla 12:10», the only thing changed is the number at the end and the book name.

Please find out more by going to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Mozilla

I tried my best to make sure the text looked the same as it would in-browser, but not everything is perfect.
