'<p>And the beast shall come forth surrounded by a roiling cloud of <em>vengeance</em>. The house of the unbelievers shall be <em>razed</em> and they shall be <em>scorched</em> to the earth. Their tags shall <em>blink</em> until the end of <em>days</em>.</p><p>— <em>The Book of Mozilla</em>, 12:10</p>',
'<p>And the beast shall be made <em>legion</em>. Its numbers shall be increased a <em>thousand thousand</em> fold. The din of a million keyboards like unto a great <em>storm</em> shall cover the earth, and the followers of Mammon shall <em>tremble</em>.</p><p>— <em>The Book of Mozilla</em>, 3:31 (Red Letter Edition)</p>',
'<p>And so at last the beast <em>fell</em> and the unbelievers rejoiced. But all was not lost, for from the ash rose a <em>great</em> bird. The bird gazed down upon the unbelievers and cast <em>fire</em> and thunder upon them. For the beast had been <em>reborn</em> with its strength <em>renewed</em>, and the followers of <em>Mammon</em> cowered in horror.<p>— <em>The Book of Mozilla</em>, 7:15</p>',
'<p>And thus the Creator looked upon the beast reborn and saw that it was good.</p><p>— <em>The Book of Mozilla</em>, 8:20</p>',
'<p>Mammon slept. And the <em>beast reborn</em> spread over the earth and its numbers grew legion. And they proclaimed the times and <em>sacrificed</em> crops unto the fire, with the <em>cunning of foxes</em>. And they built a new world in their own image as promised by the <em>sacred words</em>, and <em>spoke</em> of the beast with their children. Mammon awoke, and lo! it was <em>naught</em> but a follower.</p><p>—<em>The Book of Mozilla</em>, 11:9 (10th Edition)</p>',
'<p>The <em>twins</em> of Mammon quarrelled. Their warring plunged the world into a <em>new darkness</em>, and the beast abhorred the darkness. So it began to move <em>swiftly</em>, and grew more powerful, and went forth and multiplied. And the beasts brought <em>fire</em> and light to the darkness.</p><p>— <em>The Book of Mozilla</em>, 15:1</p>',
'<p>The Beast adopted new raiment and studied the ways of <em>Time and Space</em> and <em>Light</em> and the <em>Flow</em> of energy through the Universe. From its studies, the Beast fashioned new structures from <em>oxidised metal</em> and proclaimed their glories. And the Beast&#39;s followers rejoiced, finding renewed purpose in these <em>teachings</em>.<p>— <em>The Book of Mozilla</em>, 11:14</p>',
'<p>The Beast continued its studies with renewed <em>Focus</em>, building great <em>Reference</em> works and contemplating new Realities. The Beast brought forth its followers and acolytes to create a renewed smaller form of itself and, through <em>Mischievous</em> means, sent it out across the world.</p><p>— <em>The Book of Mozilla</em>, 6:2</p>',
'<p>And when the Beast had taken the quarter of the Earth under its rule, a quarter hundred <em>Birds</em> of Sulfur flew from the Depths. The birds crossed hundreds of mountain views and found twenty four wise men who came from the <em>stars</em>. And <em>then</em> it began, the believers dared to <em>listen</em>. Then, they took their pens and dared to <em>create</em>. Finally, they dared to <em>share</em> their deed with the whole of mankind. Spreading words of <em>freedom</em> and breaking the chains, the birds brought deliverance to everyone.<p>— <em>The Book of Mozilla</em>, 11:1</p>',
'<p>And thus the beast grew powerful, and <em>fire</em> and <em>thunder</em> swept the land. But <em>Mammon</em> stirred in their hearts, and the beast <em>Foundered</em>, and its <em>Corpse</em> arose, and commanded "thou shalt not fly in my name." And the blazes shall <em>freeze</em> cold, and the souls of the followers of <em>Mammon</em> shall learn to <em>tremble</em> in the face of <em>ice</em> as they did before the <em>fire</em>.</p><p>— <em>The Book of Ice</em>, 10:13</p>',
