00:17 --&#x3E; dotcomboom [~eric@XX-XXX-XXX-XXX.mpls.qwest.net] has joined #neocities
00:18 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> yoooo
00:22 <font color="#a3bdd7">&#x3C; hosma&#x3E;</font> eyy
00:26 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> heyo
00:26 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> and the party continues
00:26 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> woo
00:44 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> so how&#x27;s it going
00:44 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> g r a n d
00:45 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> listening to tasty music on audacious with a winamp skin
00:46 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> soothing to my ears
00:46 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> never got the winamp bug
00:46 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i always had more nostalgia for wmp9, and as a serious player, i use itunes on mac
00:48 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> I didn&#x27;t really either, even though CompuServe came with it I didn&#x27;t know what it was and never used it
00:48 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> (I think)
00:48 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> if not that then one of our old HP computers came with it
00:48 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> yeah
00:50 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i&#x27;d still love to see a modern player with those wmp visualizations though
00:50 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i can stare at any of the ambience ones for hours
00:50 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> oh yeah
00:50 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> windows media player was the bomb
00:50 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> <a href="http://wmpvis.wikia.com/wiki/Ambience"><tt>http://wmpvis.wikia.com/wiki/Ambience</tt></a> i can&#x27;t believe this is a real fucking thing, who would make this wiki
00:50 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> plenoptic was the shit too
00:51 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> fire and brimstone
00:51 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> but to my music
00:51 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> I wonder how the Media Guide was implemented in the versions that came with ME upward until at least 7
00:52 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> wasn&#x27;t it always just a browser window
00:52 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> in the application itself
00:52 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> basically
00:52 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> it might be possible to make it go to another page
00:52 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> yeah some hosts file trickery most likely
00:54 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> kind of curious of how the internet radio was implemented, m3u or something like that
00:55 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> yeah, sounds about right
00:55 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> streaming audio was weird, i dunno what else was out there aside from realplayer
00:56 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> &#x22;One common use of the M3U file format is creating a single-entry playlist file pointing to a stream on the Internet&#x22;
00:56 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> -wikipedia
00:56 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> ah
00:56 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i was trying to think of how viable a media guide would be nowadays
00:56 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> and i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be
00:56 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i don&#x27;t like the way the internet is going at all
00:56 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> social media scares me
00:56 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> getting everything in one place
00:56 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> seems way too easy
00:56 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> yep
00:57 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> a country of walled-gardens
00:58 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i don&#x27;t think it can last
00:58 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> maybe not by choice
01:08 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> Facebook might be the new AOL
01:08 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> America Online stuffed a ton of services under one thing
01:08 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> see, the freaky part is that facebook as a platform is stagnant
01:08 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> but instagram is huge
01:09 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> and that&#x27;s facebook
01:09 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> oh yeah
01:09 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> so it&#x27;s not even like they&#x27;re any closer to irrelevance
01:10 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i think my one hope is that people at least recognize that handing tons of data off to firms like this is a bad idea
01:10 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> maybe not everyone
01:10 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> but enough
01:10 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> that something&#x27;s done about it
01:10 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> and i think that&#x27;s happening
01:10 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> people were not happy about the nsa stuff
01:10 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> facebook has had tons of data breaches lately
01:13 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> these companies are trying to become everything, that your life revolves around them
01:13 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> and in the short term, they&#x27;re succeeding
01:14 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> but everything has an equal and opposite reaction
01:14 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i think the existence of alt-tech sites like gab, minds, and bitchute show that people are willing to go to smaller, less intrusive platforms
01:18 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> decentralized platforms are cool and good, but the only issue is that nothing is reversible
01:19 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> so I think privacy might be a little more difficult
01:19 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> that&#x27;s also true
01:19 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i guess the only way to win is to not play
01:20 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> which is fine by me, i&#x27;m not a narcissist
01:20 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i don&#x27;t need people to stare at everything i&#x27;m doing like it&#x27;s super important
01:21 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> adding onto the decentralized point, if you sent a ton of bitcoins to someone accidentally (or an android wallet you&#x27;re using is malicious and steals your money), good luck, you can&#x27;t contact a company to sort it out
01:21 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> bitcoin is fucked
01:21 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i doubt that&#x27;ll ever catch on
01:22 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> you can use it for stuff, technically, but do you notice it&#x27;s not a currency, it&#x27;s an asset
01:22 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> people use bitcoin like gold
01:22 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> nearly everything I see of it is just  I N V E S T I N G !
01:22 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i doubt anyone will be able to pull a proper economy out of it
01:22 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> it is a gold rush
01:22 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> the price is fluctuating so much
01:22 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> not to mention, the miners fucking over the gpu market pissed a lot of people off
01:23 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> ^
01:23 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> memecoins do not have a good reputation right now
01:23 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> and i doubt they can crawl back to having even a scrap of one
01:23 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> okay, weird aside, but you know what i goddamn love
01:23 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> joke cryptos were cool until they actually started getting value
01:24 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> feel it still by portugal the man, this fucking song is all about &#x22;fighting back&#x22; and it was absolutely huge
01:24 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> major corporations used it in ads
01:24 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> so much for &#x22;fighting back&#x22;
01:24 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> *queue seinfeld theme*
01:24 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> ironic
01:25 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i think what a lot of people (i don&#x27;t wanna say &#x22;our age&#x22; but we&#x27;re both under 20, you know what i mean) don&#x27;t realize that &#x22;fighting back&#x22; is the new mainstream
01:26 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> it&#x27;s no longer counterculture
01:26 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> conformity is the new counterculture
01:26 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> not acting like a fucking freak
01:39 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> internet of things
01:39 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> scary
01:42 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> iot is a fancy name for botnet
01:42 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> hackers getting into lights to mine batcoins
01:43 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> and insecure baby monitors
01:46 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> nasty
01:46 <font color="#f8eb6d">&#x3C; dotcomboom&#x3E;</font> quite
01:46 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i should get back to rendering out my quaddicted challenge demos
01:46 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i&#x27;ve been avoiding it because it&#x27;s a lot of heavy work with video settings
01:46 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> i notice i&#x27;m getting a lot of really dark maps and blocky footage
01:46 <font color="#7F92FF">&#x3C; mariteaux&#x3E;</font> these are meant to be archival quality so that&#x27;s not ideal
