<p>Cass The Owl is the main OC that I use to present myself to the world, she is an English barn owl who has a very simple design, the most being a red tie. As with a lot of the characters that I have made, I am okay with people having their own interpretation of <em>how</em> they think this character should look like, so in other words, if you want to draw Cass The Owl, you can change what they have on, for example, <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/48274027">people have drawn Cass with a bowtie</a>. Dress her how you think she should dress.</p>

<p>While I am okay with you dressing however you like if you want to draw her, try and <em>aim</em> to make her look like a barn owl in some way or another - saying that, you can throw this out if drawing this will be hard to do for you.</p>

<p>Despite this, in my lore for the owl, she is a barn owl. The way that <em>I</em> would draw her is with a red tie, breasts (yes, I know that owls lay eggs), and also have on a white/purple shirt. Again, I welcome any interpretation of my OCs, so this is more of a suggestion than anything.</p>

<p>It is also possible to <a href="../odds/owls.html">draw Cass the Owl simply in ASCII art</a>, as seen below;</p>

<p>As heavily inspired by that of the ZX Spectrum and, perhaps unsurprisingly if you know me, was drawn as a failed attempt to draw <a href="/xenia">Xenia, the Linux Fox</a>, Pitt is the name of this anthro vampire who's only mission in life is to feed off of the living by drinking the blood of the cattle of unsuspecting farmers - he is the terror of the civil parish village of Suffolk, England.</p>

<p>Pitt is drawn with round glasses, a dark blue shirt, a blue tie and long blond hair. He also has on a pair of pink pants (trousers), as well as a red shirt. The inside of his ears are pink and he has grey and pink shoes. Pitt has painted his nails pink.</p>

<p>All of Pitt's skin is white, but he does have visible scars on his wrists and thighs. He is transmasc, so this would mean that he has breasts, I am not transmasc myself, but in lore, Pitt still has his breasts, so I guess if you want to draw him shirtless, giving him a binder would be the best.</p>

<p>As already started, Pitt was inspired by the ZX Spectrum, a computer that had a limited color pallet, and as such, Pitt's color are only in that pallet. The hex for it is seen below, you can also <a href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/zx-spectrum">see the pallet here</a>.</p>

				<p><img src="zx-spectrum.png" alt="ZX Spectrum" title="The colors used on the ZX Spectrum; black (#000000), dark blue (#0000D8), blue (#0000FF), dark red (#D80000), red (#FF0000), dark pink (#D800D8), pink (#FF00FF), dark green (#00D800), green (#00FF00), dark blue (#00D8D8), blue (#00FFFF), dark yellow (#D8D800), yellow (#FFFF00), gray (#dD8D8D8), and white (#FFFFFF)."></p>
