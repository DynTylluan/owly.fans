<p>Cass The Owl is the main OC that I use to present myself to the world, she is an English barn owl who has a very simple design, the most being a red tie. As with a lot of the characters that I have made, I am okay with people having their own interpretation of <em>how</em> they think this character should look like, so in other words, if you want to draw Cass The Owl, you can change what they have on, for example, <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/48274027">people have drawn Cass with a bowtie</a>. Dress her how you think the way she should dress.</p>

<p>While I am okay with you dressing however you like if you want to draw her, try and <em>aim</em> to make her look like a barn owl in some way or another - saying that, you can throw this out if drawing this will be hard to do for you.</p>

<p>Despite this, in my lore for the owl, she is a barn owl. The way that <em>I</em> would draw her is with a red tie, breasts (yes, I know that owls lay eggs), and also have on a white/purple shirt. Again, I welcome any interpretation of my OCs, so this is more of a suggestion than anything.</p>

<p>It is also possible to draw Cass simply in ASCII art, as seen below;</p>
