<h1>A Very Simple Guide to Forking on GitHub</h1>

<h3><p>No alt text here!</p></h3>
		<p>While the OwlyFans website is usually very good at <a href="../../accessibility/#alt">using alt text</a>, currently none of the images on this page make use of this feature. If you don't know what alt text is, then this isn't anything to worry about.</p>
	</div>
		
	<p>If you are new to GitHub and you want to help with a project but don't know where to start, it might seem a little confusing what to do and where to begin, so this simple guide will show the basics of how to use forking on GitHub.</p>

		<p>Before anything, you will need to have a GitHub account.</p>
		
		<a href="#Step 1: Find the git you want to contribute to"><h3>Step 1: Find the git you want to contribute to</h3></a><a name="Step 1: Find the git you want to contribute to"></a>		
		<p>On your browser, go to the git that you want to make changes to, in this case, we're on <a href="https://github.com/DynTylluan/owly.fans">this git</a>. In simple terms, a git is a place that holds all of the code, pictures, sound, and everything else that is used in that project.</p>
		
		<p>If it is for a computer game, then it will have the assets for the game, if it is a website, then it will have stuff like HTML, CSS, etc on it. Git is unique as you can see the edit history for the project and who made that change and when.</p>
		
		<p><center><img src="001.png"></center></p>

				<a href="#Step 2: Go fork yourself!"><h3>Step 2: Go fork yourself!</h3></a><a name="Step 2: Go fork yourself!"></a>
		<p>On the git that you want to fork, move your mouse to <tt><font color="#81FF7F">Fork</font></tt> and then to <tt><font color="#81FF7F">Create a new fork</font></tt>. Once you do this, your browser will redirect you to a new webpage that will let you decide on what the name of your fork for the project should be. A lot of the time, it's fine to just keep this all the same, so just press <tt><font color="#81FF7F">Create fork</font></tt>.</p>
		
		<p>And boom. You now have your own version of the project. You can make your own changes to this and the original won't be affected at all. Think of it like printing a picture off of the Internet and drawing on it - the original won't change at all.</p>

				<p><center><img src="002.png"></center></p>

						<a href="#Step 3: Making changes"><h3>Step 3: Making changes</h3></a><a name="Step 3: Making changes"></a>
<p>Now that you have your own version of the git, you can make changes to it. On GitHub, you can simply just drag and drop your new files to the git. You can also delete files as well by clicking on the three dots icon that will be next to <tt><font color="#81FF7F">Add file</font></tt> button that you will see when you are either in a folder or when you are in a file.</p>
		
		<p>Once you are happy with your changes, there will be a box that says <tt><font color="#81FF7F">Commit changes</font></tt>, here you can give a title to your changes and write a description of it. Once happy, click on the green button.</p>
		
						<p><center><img src="003.png"></center></p>

		<a href="#Step 4: Making a pull request (PR)"><h3>Step 4: Making a pull request (PR)</h3></a><a name="Step 4: Making a pull request (PR)"></a>
		
		<p>You can now make a pull request (PR). This will send a message to the git of the original project that anyone can see. In this message, people usually write down their changes, why they should be added, and anything else important.</p>
		
		<p>Click on the <tt><font color="#81FF7F">Pull request</font></tt> button. This will lead you to a new page. Now, press on <tt><font color="#81FF7F">New pull request</font></tt>.</p>
		
		<p>You will once again be redirected to a new page that will show all of the changes that you made to the project. When you send in a PR, other people will also be able to see the changes that you made to the project. Once happy, press the very nice <tt><font color="#81FF7F">Create pull request</font></tt> button.</p>
		
						<p><center><img src="004.png"></center></p>
		
		<p>Now is your time to shine. Write about all of the changes that you made and why they should be merged (added) to the project. Once you are happy with what you have done, click the <tt><font color="#81FF7F">Create pull request</font></tt> button for a final time.</p>
		
		
<a href="#Step 5: Now you wait"><h3>Step 5: Now you wait</h3></a><a name="Step 5: Now you wait"></a>
		
		<p>Once you have sent out a new PR, the owner (and also anyone who follows the project) will get an E-Mail and a ping to say that you have sent out this request. On GitHub, there is a comment section on this page where people can talk about your pull.</p>
		
		<p>If the owner likes it, they will merge it, effectively adding it to their project. If the owner does not agree with the changes, they can outright reject what you did. If they want something changed, you can fix up the code by changing it on the fork that you made. You will not have to send another pull request.</p>

									<p><center><img src="005.png"></center></p>

		<p>Hopefully, your changes <em>do</em> get added. Once they do, you will be able to see yourself be credited on the <tt><font color="#81FF7F">Contributors</font></tt> section of the original git.</p>
		
		<p><em>Happy forking!</em></p>
