                This feed is set up as a way for website owners to know when I update my robots.txt as I know that there are people who use what I made on their own site.
                <p>
                The first update comes thanks to a post by Seirdy, who writes that ®Facebook/Meta updated its robots.txt entry for opting out of GenAI data scraping. If you blocked FacebookBot before, you should block meta-externalagent now [as the bot was renamed]?.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is legitimately scummy that Facebook chose to do this, but regardless, I have decided to block both FacebookBot and meta-externalagent, even if it is technically incorrect to block the former.
                </p>

				Thank you to Piper of <a href="https://yarrie.net">yarrie.net</a> for showing me this originally.
