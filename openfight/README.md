# Heyy!!

You're looking at my site files and I love you for that, that is why I am going to tell you what _this_ file is. Okay, so get ready as this is a lot to take in, but I made this file to track what mascots I have written about and what order they should appear in, got that? Good.

## Mascots I won't fight

While I know that this whole webpage is very strange and the idea of me rejecting a mascot might seem odd, but here is a breakdown of the ones I won't do and why.

* Most waifu mascots: I feel like any mascot that's just something like an anime girl is kind of hard to write about. I kind of don't like what I wrote for Pleroma-tan and Ai as it's kind of just the same thing. I was going to add Sanny and Tess («Futanari girls») from Wikipedia,I don't think I can say much for them.
* elePHPant: I can't really say much apart from «I'm going to get stepped on and not in a hot way».
* Duke of Java: I don't know what this is meant to be and I don't think I can come up with anything good - I feel like the fight would be exactly like the one with Whales of Funkwhale.
* Mozilla's dinosaur head thing: I really don't think there would be much to say about this apart from «Cass would be eaten in seconds».
* Octocat: Not open-source and one of those «All rights reserved» type cases, plus I can't be asked to write about how I would have my ass handed to me by this little guy - if you are bored [check out this art of them](https://octodex.github.com).
* Most robot mascots: Think Bugdroid (Android), Kodee (Kotlin), and DotNet Bot (.NET), etc. I feel like a lot of the fight will boil down to «they're a robot and don't feel pain so would win anyway».
* Blinky the Fish of FreeDOS: I thought they were a whale, either way, but I just had no idea what to even say.
* Wilber (GIMP): I don't know what Wilber is meant to be and the only official art of them is just a headshop, so we never see the rest of their body. IDK.
* Firefish: The mascot for this project seems to be [this abstract fish-thing](https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/joinfirefish/-/blob/main/public/branding/title.svg?ref_type=heads)... I'm really not sure what I could ever say about them.
* Friday Night Funkin': I really don't know the lore of the game - sorry!
