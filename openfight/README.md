# Heyy!!

You're looking at my site files and I love you for that, that is why I am going to tell you what _this_ file is. Okay, so get ready as this is a lot to take in, but I made this file to track what mascots I have written about and what order they should appear in, got that? Good.

## Mascots

Here are all of the mascots I have used, when I place them on the webpage, I use [this website](https://alphabetizer.flap.tv) to keep them all in order.

* Ai (藍) of Misskey
* BSD Daemon of BSD
* Ferris of Rust
* Flaxy O'Hare of Friendica
* Florence of Mastodon
* Freedoom Guy of Freedoom
* GNU Head of GNU
* Kandalf of KDE
* Kiki the Cyber Squirrel of Krita
* Kiwi of JoinFediverseWiki
* Mozilla Phoenix
* Penny The Cat of Neocities
* Pleroma-tan of Pleroma
* Rose of Mobilizon
* Sepia of PeerTube
* Tux of Linux
* Whales of Funkwhale
* Xenia of Linux
* Xue of Xfce

## Mascots I won't fight

While I know that this whole webpage is very strange and the idea of me rejecting a mascot might seem odd, but here is a breakdown of the ones I won't do and why.

* Most waifu mascots: I feel like any mascot that's just something like an anime girl is kind of hard to write about. I kind of don't like what I wrote for Pleroma-tan and Ai as it's kind of just the same thing. I was going to add Sanny and Tess («Futanari girls») from Wikipedia, but I just had no idea what to even say.
* Blinky the Fish of FreeDOS: I thought they were a whale, but I guess they are a fish. Either way, I feel like the fight would be exactly like the one with Whales of Funkwhale.
* Mozilla's dinosaur head thing: I really don't think there would be much to say about this apart from «Cass would be eaten in seconds».
* Octocat: Not open-source and one of those «All rights reserved» type cases, plus I can't be asked to write about how I would have my ass handed to me by this little guy - if you are bored, [check out this art of them](https://octodex.github.com).
