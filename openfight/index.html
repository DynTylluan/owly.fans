<h1>Open-Source Mascots I Would Beat in a Fight</h1>
<hr>
<p>Okay. So here is the deal, let's say that I am in a hand-to-hand fight with an open-source mascot, could I beat them up or would they destroy me?</p>

<p>Here are the rules: This is hand-to-hand, so even if the character is seen with some item on them, they are not allowed to use it, second, this list is only meant to say how well or poorly I would do in a fight and no way represents how I feel about a certain project. Please think of this list as only a joke, if you are a lead dev and you get offended that I put your character on here, I am willing to sort it out further by offering to fight you, yes YOU, in a one-on-one match as a way of getting revenge.</p>

<p>Okay, but for real, this is only meant to be a silly list and I thank everyone on this page for submitting their work so it is open-source.</p>

		
		<p><font color="green">Green means that I win the match</font>, <font color="yellow">yellow means that there are no winners</font>, and <font color="red">red means that I will lose</font>.</p>
		
		<p>Again, this list is only here as a bit of fun and does not reflect my opinion of the projects themselves at all.</p>

<p></p>

	<p>The BSD Daemon, also known as Beastie, is the generic mascot of BSD operating systems, they are named after software daemons. The BSD Daemon is not <em>fully</em> open-source as you need to get <a href="http://www.mckusick.com/copyright.html">permission from Marshall Kirk McKusick</a> on using the devil, but seeing that he is so near open-source, he's on this list.</a>

		<p>Look at this guy. He's soft. He's weak. He's losing. I'm winning.</p>
		
		<p>"But Cass, he has a pitchfork, can you see?" Oh, I know about that, but remember, this is hand-to-hand combat, and even if he was able to use his pitchfork, he'd still lose to me, what is he, like <a title="Equil to three foot">91CM tall</a>? Yeah, he is going straight back to Hell.</p>

<p>This is what I get. This is what I get for making this list. Well, look. Florence is a mastodon. Do you really think that <em>anyone</em> could fist-fight a mastodon? Yeah. No.</p>

<p>What is this list?</p>

<p><a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Freedoom">Freedoom</a> is the name of a stand-alone game based on the Doom engine. All material in the project is released under a modified BSD license - the game is legit <em>very</em> fun to play.</p>
			
	<p>Look, I'll be honest here - if Freedoom Guy, or as the community call him "Karl", wanted me dead, that's it for me, like, this guy, this <em>mother</em> can punch out a demon with their bare fists, it's the end for me. No contest - it's goodnight Vienna for myself.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://joinfediverse.wiki">Join the Fediverse Wiki</a> is the name of a wiki that was made as a way to aid people who might not know how to use the Fediverse all that well. The owl mascot that you see below was made by <a href="https://www.davidrevoy.com">David Revoy</a>, who also made <a href="https://www.peppercarrot.com">Pepper&#x26;Carrot</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, so I first saw <a href="https://digipres.club/web/statuses/108034405578085555">this post</a> on my timeline an hour or so after it was made and I found the owl to be <em>very</em> cute, but look. This bird is not going to fly back home tonight. Do you <em>really</em> think that they could take <em>me</em>? Yeah. It's not going to be nice at all, this is going to be too easy for me.</p>

<p>NOW LOOK. I don't want to <em>do</em> this at all, but if someone were to <em>pay me</em>, you know... money <em>is</em> money... soooo...</p>

				<a href="#Mozilla Phoenix"><h3>Mozilla Phoenix</h3></a><a name="Mozilla Phoenix"></a>
		<p>Result: <strong><font color="red">I'm dead</font></strong></p>

	<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> is the name of a web browser made by Mozilla, being worked on since 2002, it can run on macOS, Windows, Linux, and so much more. At the start of the life for the project, it was called Phoenix and had, no suprise, a phoenix as its mascot.</p>
			
	<p>Let me ask you this, could <em>you</em> beat a phoenix? Like, it's a... it's a firebird, you know, made out of <strong>fire</strong>. If anyone tied to fight a firebird, then they would get hurt and hurt bad. Look, if you <em>think</em> that you can take on this mother, be my gest, but it won't look nice and I know that I would be dead in seconds.</p>

	<p><a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a> is the name of a free webhost where you are free to make your own website.</p>
	
	<p>I'll be honest, cats kind of scare me, I feel like whenever I pet them, they are seconds away from scratching me - dogs? Sure, I'm fine with dogs, but cats? Little bastards.</p>
	
	<p>So, what would this mean? It would mean that if I were to fight Penny, then it would freak me out as I would be scared of being skratched to death, so I guess I would be unsure if I were to even <em>fight</em> Penny The Cat.</p>

		<p><a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> is the name of the free social networking service that anyone is able to use, get this, for free.</p>

<p>I'll be honest. I could take on Pleroma-tan, would I enjoy it? No, but if I <em>had</em> to, then I'm going to beat up an innocent foxgirl.</p>

<p>Look, I'll be real here, she's a very cute mascot and I always have been a sucker for anthro characters. But I would be able to beat her up. Yeah.</p>

<p>What is this list?</p>

						<a href="#Tux of Linux"><h3>Tux of Linux</h3></a><a name="Tux of Linux"></a>
		<p>Result: <strong><font color="green">I'm killing this MF</font></strong></p>

<p><a href="/tux/">Tux</a> is the defacto mascot for Linux, being first shown off in 1996, he was chosen by Linus Torvalds, the person who made Linux, to be the official brand character of the Linux kernel - The penguin was designed by Larry Ewing with an initial suggestion by Alan Cox</p>
			
	<p>This is no joke when I write these words, but I hate Tux, I hate the way that they look, I hate how smug they are, I just... <em>God</em>... I would beat the living daylights out of this stupid penguin. Even if he was somehow stronger than me, I would overpower them with my pure anger anyway. Tux is dead.</p>

				<p><a href="https://krita.org">Krita</a> is a free and open-source art program that has been used by artists since 2005. It can be ran on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and Chrome OS.</p>
				
				<p>See, I'm unsure if I could take on <a href="https://krita.org/en/about/kiki">Kiki</a>, I'll be honest, she looks like she is holding back some serious power and could beat me up with her tail also, or not, I'm not sure, she <em>might</em> be easy to take on and I could kick her furry ass - so in the end, I am unsure about this.</p>

		<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123235900/http://www.early.com/~emackey/linux/">Xenia</a> was made in the late 1990s as an alternative Linux mascot over <a href="#Tux of Linux">Tux</a>. She was made by Al Mackey; <a href="/xenia/">an article about the history of Xenia can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>Could I beat up Xenia? Could Cass beat up someone that they have <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/14jammar/folder/1049859/Xenia-the-Linux-Mascot">made so much fanart of?</a> I don't know, and that's the issue. on one hand, we are talking about silly "what ifs", but also, it <em>is</em> Xenia and she is a darling.</p>

				<p>Okay, let's just call it a draw as I'm sure that if I try and mess with her, she would get super pissed and bite me.
