		<h1><p>Open-Source Mascots I Would Beat in a Fight</p></h1>
<hr>
<p>Okay. So here is the deal, let's say that I am in a hand-to-hand fight with an open-source mascot, could I beat them up in a fight or would they destroy me?</p>

<p>Here are the rules: This is hand-to-hand, so even if the character is seen with some item on them, they are not allowed to use it, same goes for myself - no items. Second, this list is only meant to say how well or poorly I would do in a fight and no way represents how I feel about a certain project. Please think of this list as only a joke, if you are a dev and you get offended that I put your character on here, I am willing to sort it out further by offering to fight you, yes <strong>you</strong>, in a one-on-one death match as a way of getting revenge.</p>	
			<p><font color="green">Green means that I win the match</font>, <font color="yellow">yellow means that there are no winners</font>, and <font color="red">red means that I will lose</font>.</p>

	<p>Okay, but for real, this is only meant to be a silly list and I thank everyone on this page for submitting their work so it is open-source. I myself benefit from open projects on the day-to-day, using apps like <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc">VLC</a>, <a href="#Xue of Xfce">Xfce</a>, <a href="#Tux of Linux">Linux</a>, and <a href="#Mozilla Phoenix">Firefox</a> - I'm sure without them, I would be quite lost.</p>
	
		<p>Oh! Also fellow <a href="#Penny The Cat of Neocities">Neocities</a> person, <a href="https://owlsroost.xyz">Owls</a>, made <script type="text/javascript">
var images = [
'her',
'his',
'their',
]
document.write(images[Math.floor(Math.random() * images.length)]);
</script> own page on <a href="https://owlsroost.xyz/articles/tech/distro-reviews.html">reviewing Linux distros by how well their logos would work as weapons</a>, so check that ouuuut.</p>

		<p>Again, this list is only here as a bit of fun and does not reflect my opinion of the projects of the people who are apart of it at all.</p>

		<p>Also, also, also, also, if there is a mascot that I might have forgotten to add to this page, <a href="readme.html">there might be a reason why</a>...</p>

		<p><a href="https://misskey-hub.net/en">Misskey</a>, as its website says, &#xAB;is an open source, decentralized social media platform that's free forever!&#xBB; - oh my. This project seems to be aiming to be like the Twitter of the <a href="https://joinfediverse.wiki/What_is_the_Fediverse%3F">Fediverse</a> - it also seems to be a bit like <a href="#Florence of Mastodon">Mastodon</a>, but with more added to it, for example, people can react to posts with emojis. Mastodon will interpret this as favourites while <a href="#Pleroma-tan of Pleroma">Pleroma</a> will show Unicode reactions and ignore the rest.</p>
		
		<p>You can also write messages in a Markdown-variant, something that the <a href="#Kiwi of JoinFediverseWiki">Join the Fediverse Wiki</a> says has <a href="https://joinfediverse.wiki/index.php?title=What_is_Misskey%3F&oldid=8489">added support for special effects like bouncing text and sparkles</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepL_Translator">DeepL Translator</a> can also be used, but the admin will need to configure it as a way to translate posts.</p>
			
	<p>Okay, now that's out of the way, let's talk about why I'm going to beat up an innocent catgirl.</p>

	<p>See, <em>just look at her</em>, she has nothing on her, she's weak and I bet that's thanks to her being on a computer all day writing code and watching anime, while <em>I</em> spend all of my days, yes, <em>on the computer coding</em> - <strong>but</strong>, I look at <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/14jammar">Fur Affinity</a>, so hopefully, you can see why I would win this fight... yeah...</p>
	
	<p>Going to be honest when I say this, there's really not all that much I can say here - she's just some anime girl.</a>

	<p>The BSD Daemon, also known as Beastie, is the generic mascot of BSD operating systems, they are named after software daemons. The BSD Daemon is not <em>fully</em> open-source as you need to get <a href="http://www.mckusick.com/copyright.html">permission from Marshall Kirk McKusick</a> on using the devil, but seeing that he is so near open-source, he's on this list (and also people would bug me to have him here).</p>

		<p>Look at this guy. He's soft. He's weak. He's losing. I'm winning.</p>
		
		<p>&#xAB;But Cass, he has a pitchfork, can you see?&#xBB; Oh, I know about that, but remember, this is hand-to-hand combat, and even if he was able to use his pitchfork, he'd still lose to me, what is he, like <a title="Equil to around three foot">90CM tall</a>? Yeah, he is going straight back to Hell.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>, as the website for it says, is a &#xAB;language empowering everyone
to build reliable and efficient software&#xBB;, looking at code examples of it on places like Wikipedia, it kind of looks easy to pick up and learn.

<p>Okay, here comes the best part and/or the worst.</p>

<p>Babe... I don't know about you, but I sure as hell do not want my ass handed to me by a <em>crab</em>, I'm sorry, but if I go into a fighting ring with Ferris, I would not know how I would not win. I could tip them over, kick them, anything. Look bud, I am <em>not</em> gonna lose this match. End of.</p>

	<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikimedia_Cloud_Services">Wikimedia Cloud Services (WMCS)</a> is the name of a «flexible computing ecosystem built on OpenStack, GridEngine, and Kubernetes». The project allows anyone to be helped in testing and debugging in their instances. Not going to lie, I explained that poorly, but that is only as I'm not <em>fully</em> sure what this is lmao, just out here writing it.</p>
	<p>Look, I <strike>used to be</strike> <em>am a fan of</em> My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, and let me tell you, despite being little horses, some of them can really fight for their lives, and friendship may be magic, but going to the E.R. room is less so. I'm not going to win a fight against a horse, let alone a unicorn, sod that. Horses are strong things, have you ever seen one in person? Big things that you don't want to mess with.</p>
	<p>I reckon that what will happen is either, one, I'll get stabbed with that horn of theirs, two, they will run at me and trample me over, or three, I'll get run over and stabbed, so it's not looking good for your old pal Cass. Oh well, that's what I get for making this list.</p>

	<p>While I've always been more of a fan of id Software games like Doom and Quake, I think it's fair to say that getting to play Duke Nukem is also very entertaining, and it's very nice to see that people still care for the <em>other</em> Duke Nukem games that isn't just Duke Nukem 3D - this is to say, the first Duke Nukem game, now having its own open-source brother, <a href="https://djoffe.com/gnukem">Dave Gnukem</a> (love the pun).</p>
	<p>Okay, let's be real here. If <em>anyone</em> tried to go up against Duke Nukem, or even Dave Gnukem, then they are toast. This is like asking would a normal person win in a fight against Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yeah, it's just not happening.</p>

	<p>Despite being by the Wikimedia Foundation, the people who made Wikipedia, the page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Enterprise">Wikimedia Enterprise on Wikipedia</a> is very small, but to break down what this project is, it's to give a more easily consumable way of getting the data of projects from Wikimedia, including Wikipedia.</p>
	
	<p>They made the squirrel bi! Okay, but for real, am I going mad? Why is the squirrel the colors of the bisexual flag? Who knows, uh, either way, they are a <em>squirrel</em>, just pick the bastard up by their tail, swing around your head a bit, then let go - too easy. Boom.</p>
	
	<p>Note that below isn't <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikimedia_Enterprise_logo">the official render of the mascot</a>, but art by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:FibberPony">FibberPony</a>.

	<p>So, to be honest, I don't really know <em>that much</em> about red pandas, but looking at them on Wikipedia, it tells me that they are found in Japan, they are also known as the lesser panda, cat-bear, bear-cat, and <a href="#Mozilla Phoenix">firefox</a> - they <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Red_Panda_(24986761703).jpg">also look very cute</a>.</p>
	<p>So anyway, the mascot for Pixelfed is also a red panda, and, honestly... yeah, I could mercilessly kick the living shrungus out of this cute little thing, I'd just take hold of their tail and swing him above my head. I might have unchecked anger issues here.</p>

<p>What even <em>is</em> <a href="https://gnu.org">GNU</a>?? Well,,, it's like <em><strong>the</strong></em> free software people, like, let's just say this, these people love free software (free as in freedom!) so much that its founder, Richard Matthew Stallman (rms) is one of <em>those</em> nerds who just refuses to use anything that is closed-source. I mean, fair, but also shut up.</p>

<p>Now, onto its mascot -- while they are usually just seen as just their head, official artwork has shown a full body, so I thnk it would be a little weird if I were to fight just a head, I mean, can a head on its own even <em>move??</em></p>

<p>Well look, we all know where this is going to go. No way on Earth can I win a fight with a beast like the GNU mascot, I'm like,,, a normal-sized gal, so I can tell you for a fact that this guy is going to run up to me and stab me with their horns and I'll be dead in a matter of seconds. Free software wins again.</p>

<p>Now, would I beat their mascot in a fight? No, no, no. I don't want to ever mess with <em>any</em> goblin. Just the idea of them running up to me and jumping up to eat my face really makes me glad that they don't exist in real life... Or do they?! Yeah, but for real, this guy is gonna run up to me, jump up and eat my face off. But jokes aside, this guy is gonna run up to me, jump up, and eat my face off.</p>

<p>But anyway, yeah, I'd be eaten up in a really horrible way that not even AO3 could fully describe. I wonder how the people who work on GNU MediaGoblin would feel knowing that their mascot would run up to someone, jump up, and, you guessed it, <em>eat their face off</em>.</p>

It was meant to be more understandable than Paxos by means of separation of logic, but it is also formally proven safe and offers some additional features. Raft offers a generic way to distribute a state machine across a cluster of computing systems, ensuring that each node in the cluster agrees upon the same series of state transitions. It has a number of open-source reference implementations, with full-specification implementations in Go, C++, Java, and Scala. It is named after Reliable, Replicated, Redundant, And Fault-Tolerant.</em>»</p>

<p>IDK what that means.</p>

<p>But anyway, bro... What? What is that mascot? That's just a raft? Are we going off Thomas the Tank Engine logic here or...? I don't know what to say here, I mean, look at them, they are just <em>wood</em>.</p>

Ugly and creepy and they just have this stupid look on their stupid face. God, I remember when this mascot was announced. This was, in fact, the second Sudo mascot, the first being this shield, admittently not <em>that</em> interesting, but it was a downgrade to what we have now.</p>

<p>With that said, this is a bit of a Schr&#xF6;dinger's Cat situation where I don't know what will happen until reality kicks in. When I fight the sandwich, will all of their innerds (AKA food toppings) fall out and they will die at once, or will they walk towards me and I'll be there sobbing away as they start to, I don't know, eat at my arm?

<a href="#Quick Round: Other Wikimedia Related Mascots"><h3>Quick Round: Other Wikimedia Related Mascots</h3></a><a name="Quick Round: Other Wikimedia Related Mascots"></a>

<p>Okay, so there have been a few other mascots that were proposed back in the day for Wikipedia and are also semi-used for other Wikimedia projects. As I don't <em>really</em> have all that much to say about them, but ultimately want to put them on this page, I made a <strong><yell>quickfire round!!</yell></strong> for them here, let's-a-go!</p>

<strong><p><a href="#Hydra"><img src="../emoji/objects/other/anchor.svg" alt="The Twemoji emoji for the anchor (⚓) emoji." title="The Twemoji emoji for the anchor (⚓) emoji." width="20" height="20"</a><a name="Hydra"></a> <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File_talk:Wikipedia-hydra-bcuda69-rev4.png">Hydra</a></strong>: Sod this, I'm going to get eaten and not in a hot way. This is a dragon with five heads. Bye-bye.</p>

<strong><p><a href="#Miwiki"><img src="../emoji/objects/other/anchor.svg" alt="The Twemoji emoji for the anchor (⚓) emoji." title="The Twemoji emoji for the anchor (⚓) emoji." width="20" height="20"</a><a name="Miwiki"></a> <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Miwiki">Miwiki</a></strong>: A <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Miwiki_logo5-1-3.png">small ant</a> that all I have to do is step on, yippee.</p>

<strong><p><a href="#Puzzly"><img src="../emoji/objects/other/anchor.svg" alt="The Twemoji emoji for the anchor (⚓) emoji." title="The Twemoji emoji for the anchor (⚓) emoji." width="20" height="20"</a><a name="Puzzly"></a> <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Puzzly">Puzzly</a></strong>: Not sure here, they seem kind and friendly, but they might have some manic range building inside, so let's call it even.</p>

<strong><p><a href="#Sun Wik"><img src="../emoji/objects/other/anchor.svg" alt="The Twemoji emoji for the anchor (⚓) emoji." title="The Twemoji emoji for the anchor (⚓) emoji." width="20" height="20"</a><a name="Sun Wik"></a><a href="#孙维基"><a name="孙维基"></a> <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sun_Wiki.svg">Sun Wiki</a> (孙维基)</strong>: Let's be real, I'm not going to mess with any primate, I'm going to get bitten, scratched, and just torn apart. There is a killer behind that smile.</p>

				<a href="#Xenia of Linux"><h3>Xenia of Linux</h3></a><a name="Xenia of Linux"></a>
		<p>Result: <strong><font color="yellow">I'm getting bitten</font></strong></p>

		<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123235900/http://www.early.com/~emackey/linux/">Xenia</a> was made in the late 1990s as an alternative Linux mascot over <a href="#Tux of Linux">Tux</a>. She was made by Al Mackey; <a href="/xenia/">an article about the history of Xenia can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>Could I beat up Xenia? Could Cass beat up someone that they have <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/14jammar/folder/1049859/Xenia-the-Linux-Mascot">made so much fanart of?</a> I don't know, and that's the issue. on one hand, we are talking about silly &#xAB;what ifs&#xBB;, but also, it <em>is</em> Xenia and she is a darling.</p>

				<p>Okay, let's just call it a draw as I'm sure that if I try and mess with her, she would get super pissed and bite me.

<a href="#Xue of Xfce"><h3>Xue of Xfce</h3></a><a name="Xue of Xfce"></a>
		<p>Result: <strong><font color="green">I'm going to stomp on this poor creature</font></strong></p>

		<p><a href="https://xfce.org">Xfce</a> is a free and open-source desktop environment that is made for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It is meant to be fast and lightweight while still being able to have visually appealing and easy to use tools.</p>
			
		<p>As Xue is just a mouse, I feel like our fight will be easy as all I <em>really</em> need to do is just step on her, but let's face it, I feel like that would be a dull fight, I think I will give her a better chance - she might even bite me a little, but at the end of the day, she's still going to get squeezed.</p>
		
		<p>This page is going to bite me in the butt one day and that was terrible.</p>
