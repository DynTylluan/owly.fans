<h1>Open-Source Mascots I Would Beat in a Fight</h1>
<hr>
<p>Okay. So here is the deal, let's say that I am in a hand-to-hand fight with an open-source mascot, could I beat them up or would they destroy me?</p>

<p>Here are the rules: This is hand-to-hand, so even if the character is seen with some item on them, they are not allowed to use it, second, this list is only meant to say how well or poorly I would do in a fight and no way represents how I feel about a certain project. Please think of this list as only a joke, if you are a lead dev and you get offended that I put your character on here, I am willing to sort it out further by offering to fight you, yes <strong>you</strong>, in a one-on-one match as a way of getting revenge.</p>	
			<p><font color="green">Green means that I win the match</font>, <font color="yellow">yellow means that there are no winners</font>, and <font color="red">red means that I will lose</font>.</p>

	<p>Okay, but for real, this is only meant to be a silly list and I thank everyone on this page for submitting their work so it is open-source. I myself benefit from open projects on the day-to-day, using apps like <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc">VLC</a>, <a href="#Xue of Xfce">XFCE</a>, <a href="#Tux of Linux">Linux</a>, and <a href="#Mozilla Phoenix">Firefox</a> - I'm sure without them, I would be quite lost.</p>
	
		<p>Oh! Also fellow Neocities person, <a href="https://owlcollective.neocities.org">Owls</a>, made <script type="text/javascript">
var images = [
'her',
'his',
'their',
]
document.write(images[Math.floor(Math.random() * images.length)]);
</script> own page on <a href="https://owlcollective.neocities.org/articles/other/distro-reviews.html">reviewing Linux distros by how well their logos would work as weapons</a>, so check that ouuuut.</p>

		<p>Again, this list is only here as a bit of fun and does not reflect my opinion of the projects themselves at all.</p>

		<p><a href="https://misskey-hub.net/en">Misskey</a>, as its website says, &#xAB;is an open source, decentralized social media platform that's free forever!&#xBB; - oh my. This project seems to be aiming to be like the Twitter of the <a href="https://joinfediverse.wiki/What_is_the_Fediverse%3F">Fediverse</a>. Misskey seems to be a bit like <a href="#Florence of Mastodon">Mastodon</a>, but with more added to it, for example, people can react to posts with emojis. Mastodon will interpret this as favourites while <a href="#Pleroma-tan of Pleroma">Pleroma</a> will show Unicode reactions and ignore the rest.</p>
		
		<p>You can also write messages in a Markdown-variant, something that the <a href="#Kiwi of JoinFediverseWiki">Join the Fediverse Wiki</a> says has <a href="https://joinfediverse.wiki/index.php?title=What_is_Misskey%3F&oldid=8489">added support for special effects like bouncing text and sparkles</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepL_Translator">DeepL Translator</a> (DeepL) can also be used, but the admin will need to configure it as a way to translate posts.</p>
			
	<p>Okay, now that's out of the way, let's talk about why I'm going to beat up an innocent catgirl.</p>

	<p>See, <em>just look at her</em>, she has nothing on her, she's weak and I bet that's thanks to her being on a computer all day writing code and watching anime, while <em>I</em> spend all of my days, yes, <em>on the computer coding</em> - <strong>but</strong>, I look at <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/14jammar">Fur Affinity</a>, so hopefully, you can see why I would win this fight... yeah...</p>
	
	<p>Going to be honest when I say this, there's really not all that much I can say here - she's just some anime girl.</a>

The BSD Daemon is not <em>fully</em> open-source as you need to get <a href="http://www.mckusick.com/copyright.html">permission from Marshall Kirk McKusick</a> on using the devil, but seeing that he is so near open-source, he's on this list (and also people would bug me to have him here).</p>

		<p>Look at this guy. He's soft. He's weak. He's losing. I'm winning.</p>
		
		<p>&#xAB;But Cass, he has a pitchfork, can you see?&#xBB; Oh, I know about that, but remember, this is hand-to-hand combat, and even if he was able to use his pitchfork, he'd still lose to me, what is he, like <a title="Equil to three foot">91CM tall</a>? Yeah, he is going straight back to Hell.</p>

<p>Okay, so I first saw <a href="https://digipres.club/web/statuses/108034405578085555">this post</a> on my timeline an hour or so after it was made and I found the owl to be <em>very</em> cute, but look. This bird is not going to fly back home tonight. Do you <em>really</em> think that they could take <em>me</em>? Yeah. It's not going to be nice at all, this is going to be too easy for me.</p>

	<p>Let me ask you this, could <em>you</em> beat a phoenix? Like, it's a... it's a firebird, you know, made out of <strong>fire</strong>.

<p>I'm sure I'll try my very best, but let's all be real here for a moment.

		<p>This seems to be quite a good idea that I can get behind, and I suspect that if I was going to be a part of a group, this might be a good option to use.</p>

<p>With Funkwhale, you can upload your own audio and even host your own instance of the app. One thing that I did not like about the project is seemly, there is no RSS button that you can follow an account with, unlike something like <a href="#Sepia of PeerTube and Sepia Search">PeerTube</a> or <a href="#Florence of Mastodon">Mastodon</a>, but despite this, Funkwhale is a project that I will hope does well.</p>
		
		<p>Okay, now that's over with, let's talk about killing their mascot! <img src="/emoji/expressions/smileys/cats/cat_grin.svg" title="Mutant Standard Emoji showing a grinning cat face." width="25" height="25"></p>

		<p>So, this is a bit of a hard one for me, first off, let's ignore that there are three whales here and pretend that there is only one (not like it matters all that much), second, I am unsure who would win as, well, whales live in the sea and can't live on the land, unlike me. So. If this battle were to happen on land, I would win as I could just wait for the poor thing to slowly die, if it happened in the sea, the whale would win cuz they could just <a title="Eat you up, you say?">eat me</a>. Either way, the real winner is Capitalism and how we are all a slave to it - yeah, that's right, social commentary, bet ya didn't expect to see it on this page, now did ya, kid?</p>

		<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123235900/http://www.early.com/~emackey/linux/">Xenia</a> was made in the late 1990s as an alternative Linux mascot over <a href="#Tux of Linux">Tux</a>. She was made by Al Mackey; <a href="/xenia/">an article about the history of Xenia can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>Could I beat up Xenia? Could Cass beat up someone that they have <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/14jammar/folder/1049859/Xenia-the-Linux-Mascot">made so much fanart of?</a> I don't know, and that's the issue. on one hand, we are talking about silly &#xAB;what ifs&#xBB;, but also, it <em>is</em> Xenia and she is a darling.</p>

				<p>Okay, let's just call it a draw as I'm sure that if I try and mess with her, she would get super pissed and bite me.

<a href="#Xue of Xfce"><h3>Xue of Xfce</h3></a><a name="Xue of Xfce"></a>
		<p>Result: <strong><font color="green">I'm going to stomp on this poor creature</font></strong></p>

		<p><a href="https://xfce.org">Xfce</a> is a free and open-source desktop environment that is made for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It is meant to be fast and lightweight while still being able to have visually appealing and easy to use tools.</p>
			
		<p>As Xue is just a mouse, I feel like our fight will be easy as all I <em>really</em> need to do is just step on her, but let's face it, I feel like that would be a dull fight, I think I will give her a better chance - she might even bite me a little, but at the end of the day, she's still going to get squeezed.</p>
		
		<p>This page is going to bite me in the butt one day and that was terrible.</p>
