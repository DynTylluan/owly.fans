		<h1><p>Heyy!!</p></h1>
		
		<p>You're looking at my site files and I love you for that, that is why I am going to tell you what <em>this</em> page is. Okay, so get ready as this is a lot to take in, but I made this page to track what mascots I have written about and what order they should appear in, got that? Good.</p>

<a href="#Mascots I won't fight"><h3>Mascots I won't fight</h3></a><a name="Mascots I won't fight"></a>		
<p>While I know that this whole webpage is very strange and the idea of me rejecting a mascot might seem odd, but here is a breakdown of the ones I won't do and why.</p>
		<p><figure>
        <center><a href="wilber_gimp.png"><img src="wilber_gimp.png" alt="A drawing of the head of Wilber as a flying balloon in the clouds. Under their head, the name «gimp» is shown." title="A drawing of the head of Wilber as a flying balloon in the clouds. Under their head, the name «gimp» is shown." width="223" height="299"></a></center>
				<figcaption><p>Wilber, I have no idea what you are... are you a dog?? No idea.</p>
					<p>Wait, why are you now a balloon?? This just adds more questions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Most waifu mascots</strong>: I feel like any mascot that's just an anime girl is kind of hard to write about. I sort of don't like what I wrote for Pleroma-tan and Ai as it's kind of just the same thing. I was going to add <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanny_and_Tess.png">Sanny and Tess («Futanari girls») from Wikipedia</a>, but I don't think I can say much for them.</li>
<li><strong>Most robot mascots</strong>: Think Bugdroid (Android), Kodee (Kotlin), and DotNet Bot (.NET), etc. I feel like a lot of the fight will boil down to «they're a robot and don't feel pain so would win anyway».</li>
<li><strong>Blinky the Fish of FreeDOS</strong>: I thought they were a whale, either way, but I just had no idea what to even say.</li>
<li><strong>Duke of Java</strong>: I don't know what this is meant to be and I don't think I can come up with anything good - I feel like the fight would be exactly like the one with Whales of Funkwhale.</li>
<li><strong>elePHPant</strong>: I can't really say much apart from «I'm going to get stepped on and not in a hot way».</li>
<li><strong>Firefish</strong>: The mascot for this project seems to be <a href="https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/joinfirefish/-/blob/main/public/branding/title.svg?ref_type=heads">this abstract fish-thing</a>... I'm really not sure what I could ever say about them.</li>
<li><strong>Friday Night Funkin'</strong>: I really don't know the lore of the game - sorry!</li>
<li><strong>Mozilla's dinosaur head thing</strong>: I really don't think there would be much to say about this apart from «Cass would be eaten in seconds».</li>
<li><strong>Octocat</strong>: Not open-source and one of those «All rights reserved» type cases, plus I can't be asked to write about how I would have my ass handed to me by this little guy - if you are bored <a href="https://octodex.github.com">check out this art of them</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Scratch Cat</strong>: I already did an anthro cat that's orange - <a href="../openfight/#Penny The Cat of Neocities">Penny</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Wilber (GIMP)</strong>: I don't know what Wilber is meant to be and the only official art of them is just a headshop, so we never see the rest of their body. IDK.</li>
</ul>

		<p>Hopefully, this will be useful to people before they ask about a mascot that I have ruled out. Of course, if you want to make your own version of my mascot page, you are more than welcome to add the mascots that I will not do.</p>
