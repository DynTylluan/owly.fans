	<p>Cass Python had been hosting a website on her <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://notabug.org">NotABug</a> after it was deleted by the owner.</p>
	<p></p>
	
		<blockquote><a href="#First Request"><h2>First Request</h2></a><a name="First Request"></a></blockquote>
	<p>The owner of the wesbite had submitted an issue to the git of the website on GitHub on 2022-08-08:</p>

	<p><blockquote><tt>Hi, this is my website. Can you please remove it? I'm not comfortable with it being made available here. The artwork, coding, and especially all the personal info on me in this website belong to me. Please take this down.</tt></blockquote></p>
	
	<p>This would not be seen by Cass Python until 2022-09-29. Cass' reply is seen below.</p>
		<p><blockquote><tt>Apologies for not replying to this sooner - I failed to see this in my inbox until now, but I will respect this and will take action within the hour that this message was sent and remove the git</tt></blockquote></p>
	<p>The issue would be closed.</p>
	<p></p>
	
		<blockquote><a href="#Second Request"><h2>Second Request</h2></a><a name="Second Request"></a></blockquote>
	<p>On 2022-09-27, Cass would get an E-Mail from the owner of the website:</p>
	<p></p>
<blockquote>
<tt>Title: DMCA Notice</tt><br>
<tt>From: [Redacted]</tt><br>
<tt>Date: 2022-09-27 at 04:04</tt>
<p><tt>Hi, it’s me, the Creator of [website].</tt></p>

<p><tt>I left a message on your repository of my website asking you to take it down, and I don’t know if you saw it or not ? I’d like you to remove it, please. The internet archive keeps a nice record of it for historical purposes so you don’t need to worry about history being lost lol.</tt></p>

<p><tt>But seriously, it is my property. I never gave consent for it to be shared in this manner and I’m severely uncomfortable with it being shared on GitHub on your page. Remove it, or I’ll be forced to make a claim. And I would really hate to do that. (That’s not a threat, I just seriously would rather not. I have school and a job to do.)</tt></p>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li><tt>[Redacted]</tt></li>
</ul>  
</tt></blockquote>
	<p>Cass would reply to this two days later:</p>
	<p></p><blockquote>
<tt>Title: DMCA Notice</tt><br>
<tt>From: Cass &#xAB;Owly&#xBB; Python</tt><br>
<tt>Date: 2022-09-29 at 09:34</tt>

<p><tt>Sorry for the late reply, I don't check my E-Mails here all that much.</tt></p>

<p><tt>I have taken down the git with your code on.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Cass</tt></p></blockquote>
	<p></p>
			<a href="#End Result"><h2>End Result</h2></a><a name="End Result"></a>
	<p>Cass would remove the git.</p>
