    <title>Owly's RSS Thoughts</title>
    <description>Hello there, well then, welcome to my RSS feed, oh my! This will be used as what I guess could be best called an "unsocial-social network". I'm unsure if anyone has ever done this before, that is where they use an RSS feed as just a blog, but that doesn't really matter.
	
	Follow for rubbish that fills my brain. Most of what I will post should be SFW, but I may use ruse language every now-and-then!

	  The other night I was in Asda at like 21:00 when I saw a bloke in all black who also had roller-skates on, now, I'm sure if anyone else were to do this, they would look like a massive knob (myself included), but this guy... This guy just radiates cool.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Moxxie from Helluva Boss</title>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 12:20:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>
	  Full discloser: This is partly traced, using two different sources.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  As of late, I have really enjoyed Helluva Boss, a YouTube cartoon show by the same person who made Hazbin Hotel and also some other cartoons that you might have seen. Since the show came out, a lot of people have been (shamelessly) simping over Loona, and yeah, she's okay, but let's be real here, Moxxie is where it's at.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  Like my drawing that I made a few days ago of the wugs (https://www.furaffinity.net/view/41267212), this was mostly made using the crayon brush in MS Paint, taking a few hours. I also finished it off by making a simple background and giving Moxxie a white outline, done in paint.NET.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  This was quite fun to make and I hope that you like it :)
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2021 07:14:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>
	  Hello all, as some of you guys may not know, I have a new website of mine that you can checkout that is now online!
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  I am very excited to have my own site that I can do whatever I like on - a big THANK YOU to my friend Pizza Squeeze for helping me setup the site
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  The new website URL: https://owly.fans

      <title>There Are Two Wugs</title>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 04:11:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>
	  The other day, my friend Noëlle told me about The Child's Learning of English Morphology, a research study done in the 1950 by Jean Berko Gleason that basically look into the question of can children who have not been tough the basics of plurals in words still use plurals correctly? Long and short, yes, they can. The way that the children were tested was by asking them to finishing nonsense words, the most famous question shows a bird-fish-like animal called a wug.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  The question for the wug can be found here: https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/dump/2021-03/wug/01wug.jpg
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  As far as I understand (and this is not legal advice) the work done by Gleason is now in the Public Domain, although as I understand, Gleason disagrees with this as she thinks as she published the work in 2006, then it should still have a valid copyright status to it, despite the fact that the paper it is from was made in the '50s.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  Again, as I understand, Gleason has tried to take legal action against people who not only sell mech of wugs, but also images of tattoos of the animal - so far, this has failed.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  As such, I decided to put this drawing (and all future ones) I made of the wugs into the Public Domain.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  The idea of this drawing was make it look like a child made it as the original study was aimed at studding youths. I made this mostly in MS Paint with the crayon brush, with basic edits made in paint.NET, hope you like it!
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Two Giraffes With Monocles</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 11:40:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>
	  Made: 2019-03-17
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  Well, here is another from the vault so to speak. I'm not really sure why this was made, I am sure that it was a MS Paint request that someone asked of me, either way, I know that this is the second version of this, as the first somehow got corrupted to the point that it was unsaveable, so that was a shame.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  Why the two giraffes have on monocles, I have no idea, why they have on fancy hats, well it's because they look cool with them on, duh!
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  Either way, this was all made in MS Paint with no help from any-other tools. I haven't edited this from the original, apart from making it three times larger. 
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Ralsei in MS Paint</title>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 03:58:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>
	  Made 2019-03-17
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  The other day I was browsing my website when I found this old artwork that I had made in MS Paint of Ralsei, and as I thought that the quality was good (or at least good for me), I decided to upload it here to my FA. I haven't touched the art in anyway, apart from making the size of it two times bigger.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  I don't really remember making this, but thinking about the date it was made, I am guessing that I was streaming it live on a server that I was mod on at the time (now owner), that being the NeoZones Discord server https://neozones.club/discord
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Xenia in Tux Paint</title>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:23:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>
	  Made around 2020-10-12
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  A while back I was asked by my good friend Pizza Squeeze (https://squeeze.pizza) to draw Xenia, one of the proposed mascots for Linux made by Alan Mackey in Tux Paint (http://tuxpaint.org), so, here you go!
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  Making this in Tux Paint was fun and annoying at the same time, it's kind of hard to say why this was a bit of a pain in the arse to draw as I would not call myself an artist, rather someone just on the 'Net who likes to mess around with programs, but basically what I found to be annoying about Tux Paint was just small little things that really added up for me. For reference, I grew up using MS Paint, so I really got used to how to use it well. Tux Paint doesn't attempt to be an unofficial port of MS Paint and I feel like it suffers because of that, for one, there is no zoom in/out option, making it almost impossible to really look at the finer details in the art that you are making. I will say that this program is aimed at children and I'm an adult, but still, I feel like it would have helped the program and even the final art a lot.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  I also posted this on my Masto: https://digipres.club/@OwlMan/105025659030926442

      <title>Terrible Idea</title>

      <description>
	  So I see all the time that people have in their bios on social media the start date that they have been on HRT, but like, I'm not on HRT, so should I just put the first time I saw The Rocky Horror Picture Show?

      <description>Hello there, sorry that I haven't been posting all that much, sadly not much of note has been going on in my life as of now. I should have been on holiday in Wales, but due to the current COVID-19 issues, that is not possible.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  One thing that I have done today, however, was publish that I wrote about Terry A. Davis of TempleOS, so checking that out for me would be nice, as I think I did a good job at writing it; https://neozones.club/acidjaw/tech/rip/#TempleOS
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  The other day I took my two dogs out, so enjoy this photo of Rue in a bush :)

      <title>Old Rubbish I Made</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2020 07:07:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>
	  Just over a year ago, I decided to play around with image mapping in hopes that I could do something useful with it, well, as I said, it has been over a year and since I semi-published the project on an unlisted website, I have had no ideas about what I could do with the new tool. It's funny to think that at the time, I was really excited to do something with image mapping, but now, I think it's kind of useless, but I guess it could be used for things like web games, still, I don't think I will be using the skill any time soon, sadly.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  The first project that I used images mapping on involved me taking my phone camera and simply taking photos of my bookshelf, allowing the viewer to interact with the webpage, letting them click on some parts of the shelf, showing what books I own (and also my then-hairy arms) plus a little bio about the item. It was rather slap-dash, but looking at it now, I do kind of link what I made and I guess that I kind of would want to do an updated version of it with much more books, or even with my record collection, but I don't think that I will do that any time soon
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  Regardless, please enjoy Owly's Book Shelf, as dated 2019-05-05: https://neozones.club/~owly/book/

      <description>
	  I was looking through my Google Photos when I found this photo of my dogs from 2017. I guess that she would rather be lying on the floor, under the sofa than on actually *on* the darn thing? I don't know.

      <title>Francisco de Goya - Witches' Sabbath (1798)</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 04:28:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>
	  "El Aquelarre", or as it is know in English rather than Spanish, "Witches' Sabbath" is a 1798 oil on canvas by Francisco Goya that is currently held in The LÃ¡zaro Galdiano Museum (Museo LÃ¡zaro Galdiano)
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  The devil is seen here is the form of a garlanded goat, while a gathering of witches circle him. As can be seen on this oil on canvas painting, an older witch is holding infant in her hands.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  In this painting, the devil might be acting as an unholy priest at an initiation ceremony for the child, though popular superstition at the time believed the devil often fed on children, and human fetuses. The skeletons of two infants can be seen; one discarded to the left, the other held by a crone in the centre foreground.
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <description>Hello there, everyone!
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  A about a month ago I guess, my E-Friend, Randy of tehleroy.neocities.org made a post on his FA saying that he was going to do commissions, so as a way to support my friend (and to get something out of it), I did just that!  
	  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	  Here is what I got; me and my two dogs, Albert (left) and Rue (who was seen in my first RSS post). Thank you very much, Randy, and also make sure that you check out their other work.
