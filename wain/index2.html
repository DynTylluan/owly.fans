	<p>Enter the exciting world of <strong>Louis Wain</strong>, the iconic British artist who was born in 1860s London, only to find himself at the centre of the Great British puplic's attention thanks to his now-iconic and unique artwork, featutring anthropomorphised cats and kittens.</p>

	<h3>Featured Art: 'The Cat Who Got the Cream'</h3>

	<p>As with a lot of Louis Wain's artwork, this one is typical of what I have seen over the years. Wain's use of non-standered colours on the two cats is as delightful as it is strange. The carpet that this feline family are laying on is betaful, and shows how he had a keen eye for detail, even if the end result is rather kitch.</p>
	<p>While we don't know what he was thinking when this was made, I, for one, think that the cats has a very curius look to them, like they just spotted something very strange indeed - prehaps they saw a pink dog.</p>
