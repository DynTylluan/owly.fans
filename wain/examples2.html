	<p>During his lifetime, Wain would make countless artworks of cats but a lot of the time, he failed to date the artwork that he made, so please keep in mind that the order of the art on this page is not meant to be chronological.</p>

	
	<h2>Scrumping Apples</h2>
	<p>A very happy cat is about to steal (scrump) some apples off of a tree. I love this one a lot as I feel like it's very relatable - who has not stolen fruit off of a tree at some point in their life? I'm willing to bet that as a boy, Louis Wain was guilty of scrumping.</p>

	<h2>Cat's Nightmare</h2>
	<p>A rather unique art from Wain thanks to the main focus of this artwork being not about cats, but of owls (althought this is still the bightmare of the cat). I think that this artwork is wondafully charming and funny - I just love the reaction seen on the cats faces, especally the one cat that is huddaling under the blanket, oh, and the annoyed faces that the owl's have puts a big smirk on my face.</p>
