Copyright 2021, Charlotte Som (the "Author" henceforth).

This license gives everyone permission to examine, modify, and use this software
and the associated documentation (the "Inator"), without patent obstacles, while protecting
the Author and any contributors (the "Composers") from liability.

Each Composer permits you to examine, modify, utilize, and distribute the Inator

they hold.

No contributor may revoke this license, but the Author may choose to release the Inator
(including the contributed works of any other Composer) under a different license.

You may not use the Inator to accrue revenue without explicit permission from the Author.

You may not use the Inator to do Malevolence. If you are
notified that you have committed a Malevolence instrumented by the Inator, your license is
terminated unless you take all practical steps to comply within a reasonable timeframe.

The definition of Malevolence is at the discretion of the Author. It may include, but is not
limited to:

- The promotion of bigotry, including: sexism, transphobia, homophobia, ableism, or the 
perpetuation of racial oppression.
- Causing a detriment to public health.
- Instigating political, economic, or corporeal violence.
- Entrenching an empire.
- Where applicable, use of the Inator without the informed consent of a second party who may
object to its use.
