					<p>So yeah, that's my Minecraft world. I thought it would be cool if I were to make a page dedicated to it, despite my world not even being a week old yet! Hopefully, you liked it as much as I do. Oh, by the way, it's not vanilla Minecraft! I'm using a mod called Better than Adventure! (<a href="https://bta.miraheze.org">bta.miraheze.org</a>) that's very cool and is along the lines of "what if beta 1.7.3 never stopped?" - it's good fun!</p>
