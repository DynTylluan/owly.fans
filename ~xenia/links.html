<p>Here are some websites and stuff that I think are really cool (not as cool as my website, though ;P) and really worth checking out, <a href="mailto:xenia@thedigitallancabin.net">email me if I forgot something good</a>!</p>

					<h2>Games</h2>
					<p>I may be a 40-odd-year-old fox, but I love gaming! So here is a fun selection of free games that you can play now :0</p>
					<p><img src="pin.png" alt="Red pin icon." title="Red pin icon."> <a href="https://github.com/MissLavender-LQ/LibreQuake">LibreQuake</a>: I loved Quake growing up in the 1990s, yeah, Doom was fun, but <yell>come on!</yell> It's Quake! I've talked to the person who is the head of this project a few times, that being <a href="https://misslavender.neocities.org">Miss Lavender</a>, seems to all-in-all be very nice.</p>
					<p><img src="pin.png" alt="Red pin icon." title="Red pin icon."> <a href="https://supertuxkart.net">SuperTuxKart</a>: Banger. Such a fun racing game that I love to play whenever I have friends around and also play online. <a href="https://online.supertuxkart.net/addons.php?type=karts&name=xenia">Also what's really cool is that someone made a kart of me</a> >:D</p>
					<p><img src="pin.png" alt="Red pin icon." title="Red pin icon."> <a href="https://freedoom.github.io">Freedoom</a>: I loved Doom growing up in the 1990s, yeah, Quake was fun, but <yell>come on!</yell> It's Doom! I've talked to the person who is the head of this project a few times, that being <a href="https://soulsphere.org">Simon Howard</a>, seems to all-in-all be very nice.</p>
					<p><img src="pin.png" alt="Red pin icon." title="Red pin icon."> <a href="https://www.minetest.net">Minetest</a>: It's crazy to think that there are people making whole games 100% for free and are as good as the legit things. Minetest is a great example of this (<a href="https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/">also try MineClone2</a>!).</p>
					<p><img src="pin.png" alt="Red pin icon." title="Red pin icon."> <a href="http://supertux.org">SuperTux</a>: Amazing. I love this game so much <yell>and so should you!!</yell></p>
					<p><img src="pin.png" alt="Red pin icon." title="Red pin icon."> <a href="http://conceptlab.com/simulator/">The Simulator</a>: I still remmeber when one of my school friends sent me this URL in 1998 (over IRC!!). It's a fun little game that's oddly funny at times.</p>										<h2>Tools</h2>
					<p>Here are a number of things that I use on the daily that I think you'd find very useful.</p>
					<p><img src="pin.png" alt="Red pin icon." title="Red pin icon."> <a href="https://kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a>: So as I live in the middle of no where, a lot of the time my internet can be <i>very</i> slow. So bascally over a good few days, I left my computer on 24/7 while I downloaded a torrent of Wikipedia - and guess what? I can use Kiwix to view that website (as well as loads of other wikis) even without internet! So, so useful.</p>
					
					<p><img src="pin.png" alt="Red pin icon." title="Red pin icon."> <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hitchhiking">Hitchhiking on Wikivoyage</a>: A very, <i>very</i> useful guilde on how to,.. well, hitchhike across the place.</p>
						
					<p><img src="pin.png" alt="Red pin icon." title="Red pin icon."> <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>: This might be one of the best search engines that I know of. I stopped using Google in 2016, so this was a good replacement.</p>
						
					<p><img src="pin.png" alt="Red pin icon." title="Red pin icon."> <a href="http://www.castlewales.com/">Castles of Wales</a>: Info for castles in the UK... well, Wales...</p>
