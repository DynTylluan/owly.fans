===============================================================================

Hello there, welcome to the README for my website! My name is Xenia and I
wanted to allow anyone to be able to see the contents of my site freely, so
here you go :D

Note that, unlike the git for
owly.fans (https://github.com/DynTylluan/owly.fans), this repository is
independent to the /~xenia website, so just because there is a page or piece of
text on the live site, it doesn't necessarily mean that it will be on this git.
My website is not hosted on GitHub Pages!

Oh, and by the way, before you edit anything, PLEASE look at the LICENSE.txt
and understand that if you send in a PR for this site, then your new
content/changes will also be under the same license!
