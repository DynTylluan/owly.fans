					<p><font color="#8b0000">Xenia</font>: Logging on!</p>
					<p>Hello gang, over the week of October 2023, I wasn't in E<yell>n</yell>gland, but I was in Wales to see family who live there, buuut, when I was not able to be on my normal desktop computer setup, I <i>was</i> about to take my IMB ThinkPad X10 with me on this trip, and while I was away, I took some time to my self so I could work on some things with my website that were bugging me!</p>
					
					<p><a href="old_website.png"><img src="old_website.png" width="334" height="360" align="right" alt="Screenshot of my old websaite layout. It has a banner at the top that says 'Welcome to Xenia's site!'. It also has a black background and a few web banners at the bottom." title="Screenshot of my old websaite layout. It has a banner at the top that says 'Welcome to Xenia's site!'. It also has a black background and a few web banners at the bottom."></a></p>
					
					
					
					<p>One think that was on my mind a lot with my site was that, well, it's not 1997 anymore! People no longer log online with crappy little dial-up modems, so because of this, I added a cool little background image! The background was taken from a game that I <i>love</i> called <a href="https://freedoom.github.io/">Freedoom</a>. What I did was I took one of the textures from the game (a game that is open-source) and edited it around a little so that it will look nice on a website background, and <yell>boom!</yell>, we have our new background image!</p>
					
					<p>But wait... there's more! This website also now has a light and dark mode to it, so if you have your device on a light theme, you might not even <yell>see</yell> the same background that I'm talking about! The <i>other</i> background was taken from <a href="https://github.com/MissLavender-LQ/LibreQuake">LibreQuake</a>, another cool open-source game!</p>
					
					<p>Another reason why I wanted to have a new background was that I hated how just having <i>black</i> as the backdrop kind of makes my website feel... well.... I guess edgy? I'm not some edgy teenager in 1997 living in my mum's basement on my computer 24/7 while in the background I watch my VHS copy of The Matrix while I IRC chat with my friend Kyle about how I got ripped off with my second-hand buy of a Nintendo 64 game controller that stears slightly to the left. Soon to update my Geocities fan page on "The Nightmare Before Christmas" to impress my other loser school friends who will no doubt drop out and sell skunk on the side as they are trapped in a shitty job working at some shop in the middle of no where.</p>
					
					<p>so yeah, that's kinda why I wanted to update my website background. Anyway, here is the un-touched version of the backgound for light mode users:</p>

	<p>Another change that I wanted to do was make it so the CSS file for this website was updated. I wanted to change stuff like the link and text colours around a tad bit, mosltly so they just <i>merge</i> better with our new background. Well, how did I do? I think as it's almost Halloween, I might want to update the website so it's horror-themed? I don't know, but we will see! So make sure you <a href="myrss.xml">keep an eye on my RSS feed to know when I update next!</a>
	
		<p>So yeah, that's the updates for now, if you want to know what I'm working on right now for my website, well I'm making a "mailbag" page where I'll be answering people's questions that they send to me. If you want to see one of your questions answered, EMail me: <a href="mailto:xenia@thedigitallancabin.net"><em>xenia@thedigitallancabin.net</em></a>
