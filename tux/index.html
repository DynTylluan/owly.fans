		<p>okay... i am jumping the gun a little bit, so i might as well break down why i hate tux the penguin so much and to a lessur exstent, linux itself
			
			1. linux is just dumb, why cant you just use windows?? hello?? earth to linux users, hello??

			
			2. <tt>sudo</tt> can such a fat one
		am i a slave to sudo or something? why do i always have to open up  a terminial <strong>like some sort of hacker????</strong> i am not going to open a termaiol. "oh sudo, can you please check my audio?", "can u (you) plz (please) fix my audio>??", "sudo can i lick you're boots????" - yeah, no t h ank you. i am 20 two and i alraeady know that windows is better than the mess that is linux...
			<p>
			<h5>linux is just dumb, okay?</h5>...i am calm, okay? i am not anyey9p (angrey)... okay i am maddog, i am evil and also gay (more bi/pan but i use the term "gay" as more of an umbrella term in this case) and i am also transgeener <img src="../emoji/gsr/gsd/flags/transgender_flag.svg" title="the mutant standard version for the trans flag emoji (&#x1f3f3;&#xfe0f;&#x200d;&#x26a7;&#xfe0f;)" width="35" height="35"> (no terfs) so that measn i know what i am on about... im also on mastodong dot gov so that means that i am aware of open sourec shnanagans and i can tell you for a god gosh fricking fact that linux sucks... <em>sighs</em>
