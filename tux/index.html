		<p>Okay... i am jumping the gun a little bit, so i might as well break down why I hate Tux the Penguin so much and to a lessur exstent, Linux itself
			
			1. LInux is just dumb, why cant you just use WIndows?? Hello?? Earth to Linux users, hello??

			
			2. <tt>sudo</tt> can such a fat one
		Am i a slave to sudo or something? why do i always have to OPEN UP  A TERMINIAL <STRONG>LIKE SOME SORT OF HACKER????</STRONG> I AM NOT GOING TO OPEN A TERMAIOL. "oh sudo, can you please check my audio?", "can u (you) plz (please) fix my audio>??", "sudo can I lick you're BOOTS????" - YEAH, NO T H ANK YOU. I AM 20 two and I alraeady know that WIndows is BETTER THAN the mess that is Linux...
			<p>
			<h5>LINUX IS JUST DUMB, OKAY?</h5>...i am calm, okay? I am not anyey9p (ANGREY)... oKAY I AM MADDOG, I AM EVIL AND ALSO GAY (more bi/pan but I use the term "gay" as more of an umbrella term in this case) and i am also TRANSGEENER <img src="../emoji/gsr/gsd/flags/transgender_flag.svg" title="The Mutant Standard version for the trans flag emoji (&#x1F3F3;&#xFE0F;&#x200D;&#x26A7;&#xFE0F;)" width="35" height="35"> (No TERFs) so that measn i KNOW what I am on about... im also on mastodong dot gov so that means that I am aware of open sourec shnanagans and I CAN TELL YOU FOR A GOD GOSH FRICKING fact that linux sucks... <em>sighs</em>
