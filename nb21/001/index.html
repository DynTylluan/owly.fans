You look... great..., uhhh, anyway, welcome to issue one of nb21, this is really issues two as <a href="/nb21/000/">we <em>already</em> had a first issue</a>, but that was only a pilot, so calling it the first is <em>kind of</em>, sort of, wrong. Hmm.</p>
			<p><strong>Anyway</strong>, this issue we will take a peek at, <em>wow</em>, art, some very nice hand-picked websites, as well as a very cool photo that we are just oh so sure that you will love. Why are we taking so long to get to the good parts? Come on, let's get to the <em>real</em>meat and potatoes of this issue, that's right, <em>the sponsor!</em> <em>(Crap)</em></p>

	<p>Hey <strong>nerd</strong>, you like classical art? You're a furfaaaa- <em>furfan</em>? Get your eyes on this, then.</p>
	<p>In 1767 or so, French painter and printmaker <a title="Born in Grasse, France on 1732-04-05 and died in Paris on 1806-08-22 at the age of 74." alt="Born in Grasse, France on 1732-04-05 and died in Paris on 1806-08-22 at the age of 74.">Jean-Honoré Fragonard</a> made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swing_(Fragonard)"><em>The Swing</em></a>, something that is now considered to not only be one of Fragonard's best known works, but also a masterpiece in its own right.</p>
	<p>Despite how people feel about it today, the 1767 artwork was quite contaversial to say the least, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF3YsSW1tzE">but that's a story for this video</a> - oh my.</p>

<p>Look, bud, I'm a sucker for cute stuff liek this - and so are you -- or not, I don't know, I'm not you (sadly), either way, I feel like this is a very cute sketch by this sketch.

	<p>Tarrow cards normally look cool, but the ones made by Matthew Lopz look extra cool. A lot of the art by Lopz, something that can be <a href="https://matthewlopz.newgrounds.com">seen on his Newgroudns</a> has a very unique look to them, partly to the use of the colors used in them and, of couse, the stalisation that has been given to his charaters.</p>
		
<p>Another example of his art that I am quite fond of would be <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/art/view/matthewlopz/considering-to-sell-my-soul"><strong>Considering to sell my Soul</strong></a>, that has an almost cult-like feeling to it.</p>

			<p>Very cool artwork by Br.kennedy.lucas that takes infuance from the block-building game, Minecraft, showing the voilent battle between Herobrine, the urban legend and creepypasta who haunts single-player Minecraft worlds, and the player, seen here as Steve. I give credit here to Br.kennedy.lucas for the use of putting the name of the computer game at the very top center of the peice, almost as a way of getting us, the viewer, to just remember just how big the game was to us growing up.</p>
			<p>The anger in Steve's face is almost funny in a way and can be seen as an almost commenty on how some players can react while playing games, especally ones with mulit-player. Herobrine, on the other hand, shows us anger. He's pissed off - prehaps could it be that Steve did something to anger him - destroy a part of the world that he did not want touched, prehaps?</p>
				
			<p>(I supect that this was made by the child of Br.kennedy.lucas, mostly due to the fact that <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Br.kennedy.lucas&title=Special%3ASearch&profile=advanced&fulltext=1&ns0=1&ns6=1&ns12=1&ns14=1&ns100=1&ns106=1">this WIkimedia user has uploaded a lot of work that a child would not have intrest in</a>, but will still be credited under this name, for contanuity sake.)</p>
	<p></p>

		<p>Update: Before this issue was published, the worst happied... <tt>Herobrine vs Steve.jpg</tt> got deleted from Wikimedia Commons as <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Hellknowz">User:Hellknowz</a> does not &#xAB;see a realistic scenario where this fictional imagining losely based on a video game can be used for any educational purpose or any purpose really&#xBB; - for shame.</p>

<p>I feel like if you really get to know me, Cass Python, then you will find out two things: first is that I am really funny, kind of a shame too as being funny gives me gender dsysphoria, mostly as women arn't meant to be funny, second is that I am quite the <em>Red Dwarf</em> fan, so seeing that there has been artwork that shows a furry version of Lister and Rimmer was very exciting to see - plus what helps is that the artwork made is quite good looking.</p>

	<p>Sorry screen reader users lol</p>
	<p>If you know anything about anything, then you will know that <tt>Hello World</tt> is a classic in programing - it's used as a way of displaying simple text, some examples are</p>
		<a href="#Python"><strong>Python</strong></a><a name="Python"></a>
	<p><em>Hello world</em> in Python is very simple, it's just the floowing:</p>
	<p><p>
	<blockquote><code style="color:rgb(227, 223, 255); font-weight:400;background-color:rgb(45, 43, 87);background:rgb(45, 43, 87);display:block;padding: .5em;"><span style="color:rgb(251, 158, 0); font-weight:400;">print</span>(<span style="color:rgb(76, 210, 19); font-weight:400;">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>)</code></blockquote>
	<p></p>
		<a href="#JavaScript"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a><a name="JavaScript"></a>
	<p>JavaScript is also simple, just being:</p>
	<p><p>
	<blockquote><pre><code style="color:rgb(227, 223, 255); font-weight:400;background-color:rgb(45, 43, 87);background:rgb(45, 43, 87);display:block;padding: .5em;">console.<span style="color:rgb(251, 158, 0); font-weight:400;">log</span>(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);</code></pre></blockquote>

	<p>While not a code, HTML has a few more lines, but is fairly easy to understand:</p>

	<p>Okay. You get the point and you know where this is going. We're going to talk about esoteric programming languages and their Hello, World versions. Huh? <em>What's an &#xAB;esoteric programming&#xBB;??</em></p>
	<p>Okay, sit down, kitten. Mommy is going to tell you all a story. So a bunch of nerds all around ther world were unhappy with how simple and easy some code languages were, so they made their own - there's <a href="https://esolangs.org">even a wiki</a> where we got all of the examples from and is a good starting point. To be honest, it looks like a lot of fun to be able to make your own silly language, but a lot of the examples are just stilly.</p>
	<p>Got that? Okay, let's-a-go!</p>
		<p></p>
	<a href="#FiM++"><strong>FiM++</strong></a><a name="FiM++"></a>
	<p>Strong start, I know, but as made by Cereal Velocity, who fun fact is one of the bloggers on Equestria Daily, <strong><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/FiM%2B%2B">FiM++</a></strong> is based... <em>based?</em>... based upon the TV show <strong>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</strong> and its syntax and structure are inspired by Java and ALGOL.</p>
	<p>The Hello, World for the program looks a little soemthign like this:
		
		<pre><code style="color:rgb(227, 223, 255); font-weight:400;background-color:rgb(45, 43, 87);background:rgb(45, 43, 87);display:block;padding: .5em;"><span style="color:rgb(76, 210, 19); font-weight:400;">Dear</span> Princess Celestia: Hello, World!

<span style="color:rgb(76, 210, 19); font-weight:400;">Today</span> I learned something simple.
<span style="color:rgb(76, 210, 19); font-weight:400;">I</span> said “Hello, World!”!
<span style="color:rgb(76, 210, 19); font-weight:400;">That</span>&#x27;s <span style="color:rgb(250, 101, 141); font-weight:400;">all</span> about something simple!

<span style="color:rgb(76, 210, 19); font-weight:400;">Your</span> faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.</code></pre>
	<p>The way that the lnaguage works was inspried by the ending of early episodes of the show, where studiant Twighlight Sparkle would write to Princess Celestia, telling her what she learnt.</p>
	<p>Oh hey, there's even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huPfNx5oCcA">a video on it</a>.</p>
			<p></p>
	<a href="#ArnoldC"><strong>ArnoldC</strong></a><a name="ArnoldC"></a>
			<p></p>
		<em><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/ArnoldC">ArnoldC</a></em> also seems to be quite a funny language that was made by Lauri Hartikka, using Scala. The Hello, World for it looks like this:</p>
		<p></p>
		<pre><code style="color:rgb(227, 223, 255); font-weight:400;background-color:rgb(45, 43, 87);background:rgb(45, 43, 87);display:block;padding: .5em;">IT<span style="color:rgb(172, 101, 255); font-weight:400;">&#x27;S SHOWTIME</span>
TALK <span style="color:rgb(251, 158, 0); font-weight:400;">TO</span> THE HAND <span style="color:rgb(76, 210, 19); font-weight:400;">&quot;Hello, World&quot;</span>
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED</code></pre>
		<p>the language itself uses famous quotes said by Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
		<p><p>
				<a href="#Zalgo"><strong>Zalgo</strong></a><a name="Zalgo"></a>
			<p>Remember the part where we wrote that <a href="#jdfsdkfjghkrjrgjkfgkd by Kapten Charlie">jdfsdkfjghkrjrgjkfgkd by Kapten Charlie</a> was going ot be hard for screenreaders? So do I, so do I...</p>
			<p>As our own rule of three, our third example code that is weird and we will never want to lean is <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Zalgo">Zalgo</a> by Short c1rcuit that was inspored by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalgo_text">the Zalgo text meme</a> that was big in... 2004? Man, I'm old. Regardless, the Hello, World program for it is a mess, as you can see below:</p>
			<p><pre><code style="color:rgb(227, 223, 255); font-weight:400;background-color:rgb(45, 43, 87);background:rgb(45, 43, 87);display:block;padding: .5em;"><span style="color:rgb(251, 158, 0); font-weight:400;">A</span>̝̝̝̝̝̝̝̝̝̝̝̝̝̐̈̄̐̅̆̐̌̆̐̌̆̐̏̆̐̌̂̐̀̂̐̇̇̐̏̆̐̂̇̐̌̆̐̄̆̐́̂</code></pre></p>
			
			<p>Nice. The language itself operates on clusters of combining diacritical marks.</p>
<br>
	<p>For more weird and funbky computer languages, going on the <a href="https://esolangs.org">Esolang wiki</a> is a good start.</p>
