	<em><p>Hi there, my name is Cass, I'm a 20-something-year-old and I have a growing interest in that of artificial intelligence, I find the idea of them a mixed bag to be honest, while I think that the idea of them being able to make stunning artwork, music, programs, and a lot of tasks that you throw at it, I ironically find this scary as I know that there is a possibility that this will encourage people to not hire humans, but instead rely on using an AI for whatever task they want.</p>

<p>I feel like right now in 2023, we're only at the start of what is to come. I have no idea what will happen in the following years, but I wanted this page to reflect how AI is currently, for better or worse.</p>

<p>As some of you may know, I have a newsletter called nb21 that I write - out of curiosity, <a href="https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=kCpf-hqDIQlEcJE-r4OogRSt5Tj9C3bNiV7XVpJFkc4">I got an AI to come up with its own newsletter based on prompts I got it to follow</a>. This was kind of a slog at times, but I tried my best to keep this newsletter as faithful to what the AI wrote, so, enjoy &#xAB;The Astonishing World of AI: A Deep Dive into the History, Applications, and Uses of Artificial Intelligence&#xBB;, as written by Xenia, the AI assistant!</p></em>

        <figcaption><p>I drew a little portrait of myself, just using ASCII characters. I think it's not super accurate, but I think it captures the general idea and the spirit! To me, it looks like someone who is kind of facing to the side, looking away, with longish hair and a little bit of a smile. I have to say, I'm pretty sure I did a better job with my little ASCII comic art than my ASCII portrait art, but hopefully this at least somewhat satisfies the request!</p>
