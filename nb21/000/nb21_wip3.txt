<p>We did it. We jumped the shark. Issue 0 and we have all gone too far - well, goodnight, everybody!</p>
<p>[Theme music plays]</p>
<p>Okay, well sadly we can't just <em>not</em> have a blank first issue... or zeroth issue... 0th... 0st? Uh, a pilot... I don't know, anyway, read this newsletter please and I will forever be in your debt. Thank you uwu.</p>
<p>This issue, we will be looking at a lot of art, like, a lot of it, a few Web links that you will <strong>really</strong> enjoy, as well as a few videos that you should watch with your eyes - you got that, kid?</p>

<p>As of late, Owly made the error of checking out her old Twitter page and by doing so, she saw a bunch of old artwork that they stared and because over on at NeoZones we're all art nerds, we thought that you - our very nice reader - <em>might</em> enjoy some of the art that at this point is a bit old, <strong>but whatever</strong>, we can link old art - and Hell, what are you going to do about it, huh? Call the police like some kind of rat, ay, that's what I thought.</p>
	
	<p>Uh, anyway, enjoy some of the art here.</p>

<p>I, Cass, currently have two dogs that I love very much, but from what I can guess from other people, the term «wet dog smell» seems to be a thing that people <strong>really</strong> do not like. I don't know if this is just me or not, but whenever my dogs get wet, they don't <em>really</em> smell all that much, and trust me, they just <em>love</em> to run around in boggy pools - regardless, the dog in this artwork made the right decision of putting on a raincoat, plus they also have an umbrella (very cute - I love it!).</p>

	<p>Bat OCs: they look cool, but there are very few puns that you can make for them, I <em>guess</em> you could say that they suck, if it <a title="Hello, Cathy" alt="Hello, Cathy">your OC is a fruit bat</a>, then you can say that <a title="Hello, Bruno" alt="Hello, Bruno">you're a bit fruity</a>, but that's really it when it comes to bat puns. Regardless. This fella looks very cute and I don't know <em>why</em> someone would not want to invite her to a barbecue, <em>might be because all she talks about is pre-<a title="pisstoric" alt="pisstoric">historic</a> animals?</em>

<p>How, oh, how did we not find out about this artist before now? Looking at their art online, Jordan Speer of @Beefstrong has been going strong for a long time now - their art is... weird? Fun and very unique to see, this is mostly down to, what I think, is the ability to somehow look like they used a 3D art program and oil paints at the same time, but I guess at the end of the day, this doesn't matter as their art speaks a whole lot more.</p>
		
		<p>Jordan Speer, who is the creature of this work, has been commissioned in the past by names like Bloomberg Businessweek and The New York Times. The artwork of Speer can be seen as almost a 3D artist version of Felix Colgrave, who is known for such videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_MSFkZHNi4&t=3s">DOUBLE KING</a>.</p>

	<p>catboots, oh catboots.</p>
	<p>people who have been following my online activity will be aware that I have been aware of this artist for some time - making a color edit to one of their older comics, <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/fdad/knd">Kent &#x26; Deniel&#x27;s Plain Ol&#x27; Sunday</a> in 2018. So I feel like it should be fitting to feature one of their works in the first issue of nb21.</p>

<p>Over the past however long, Cass Python (wait, that's me) has been going around on Minecraft servers, trying to hunt down signed books and archive the text for them, not to honk my own horn, but there are some interesting books here, such as these three: <a href="https://github.com/DynTylluan/mcbooks/blob/main/books/ghostbusters_69_onlinedevil.md">Ghostbusters 69</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DynTylluan/mcbooks/blob/main/books/unsigned5_unknown.md">Unsigned</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/DynTylluan/mcbooks/blob/main/books/unsigned6_unknown.md">another unsigned book</a>.</p>
<p>There are a lot more books in the git and it will grow even larger with time as more books are found and achieved, so keep an eye on it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57626403">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57626403</a></p>
	<p>Kind of an old article at this point but still very much worth reading. <em>But what is it?</em> Well, as technology grows more and more, it means that we are going to see many jobs go away or change in ways that we cannot imagine, one field of work that will change for the better will be fire lookouts, so public servants who are physically inside of a tower to make sure that the area that they are meant to guard - a lot of the time a wood or natural area, is safe - mostly from fires. This work is becoming more and more rare thanks to things like drones, satellites, and aircraft.</p>
	
	<p>The article follows a number of these lookouts; their day-to-day life. It's a good read overall. Here is a small segment from it that talks about the growth in technology;</p>

		<blockquote><p>"We are being replaced, for sure," [Reza Fakhrai, lookout] says. Satellites can detect heat and flames on the earth's surface, while drones and aircraft can fly around and grid a certain area or look for smoke from the sky. "So there are a lot of replacements for lookouts," he said.</p>

<p>States across the US are closing fire lookout towers as new technology comes in, transforming some into accommodation. In New Mexico, the forest service has in recent years deployed drones to monitor blazes. And while there were once thousands of lookouts and towers across the US, now there are far fewer - the state of Wisconsin closed its last 72 lookout towers in 2016, for example.</p>

<p>But there remains a place for people on the ground looking out for fires. Lookouts know the terrain; they can help direct firefighting resources from their towers by radio. And by the time satellites detect fires they sometimes have grown too large, leaving authorities with fewer options to control them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hey kid, you remember Rocky Horror? What's that? Y-You don't? Uh, well, it's a movie that you should ask your parents about.</p>
<p>Regardless, this video, with currently less than 5,500 views, is all about Shock Treatment - the movie with the tagline of «It's not a sequel... it's not a prequel... it's an equal» (script writter Richard O'Brien later called it «an abortion»). The film was hated at the time, something I would say would be down to it's confusing plot. A lot of the time when watching a movie, having the whole plot told to you before watching it would make watching it less fun, but Shock Treatment is somehow better when the plot is explaned to you.</p>
<p>Uh, I feel like the music is worth playing, at least. <em>Fellas, is it a bit fruity to like Rocky Horror and Shock Treatment?</em></p>	
	
	<blockquote><a href="#Future Issues"><h2>Future Issues</h2></a><a name="Future Issues"></a></blockquote>
<p>Hey, uh, hi it's Owly here saying that, yes, this is only a pilot for a possible biweekly newsletter, much like the <a href="https://neozones.neocities.org/acidjaw/mail/issue0">old AcidMail</a>, we are trying this out to see what people would think of the idea of not only a newsletter that but also a newsletter/zine that people would help edit and add content to.</p>
<p>Bascally, we want to have three factors as to if more issues will be made:</p>
<blockquote><p>One: More than two people care about this idea</p></blockquote>
<p>If no-one would have no interest in reading it, I fail to see why I would want to put in the time to carry on making it, ya know?</p>
<blockquote><p>Two: People are willing to help write it.</p></blockquote>
<p>AcidJaw was 90% written by myself and it took a lot of time and effort out of me, so it would be good to have other people make content for this newsletter, such as art, web links, or even their own text.</p>
<blockquote><p>Three: If people <em>are</em> willing to make original content for this newsletter, it must be Creative Commons</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply so others can share it around - also, I feel like if it is not using an open licence, then the issue of who owns what will come into play, this is why I have always aimed at trying to always use an open licence when making anything.</p>
	<p>Currently, this project is using <a title="Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported" text="Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0</a>, so this means that a person can freely:</p>
	<p><blockquote>Share the work</blockquote></p>
<p>This just means that they can copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.</p>
	
	<p><blockquote>Adapt the work</blockquote></p>
<p>So a person can take the work and edit it to their liking and publish that</p>
	
	<p>But a person has to follow the three rules:</p>
	
	<p><blockquote>Give us credit</blockquote></p>
<p>In short, a person must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.</p>
	
	<p><blockquote>Not make money off the work</blockquote></p>
<p>Simple. A person can't sell nb21 as-is.</p>
	
	<p><blockquote>Use the same license</blockquote></p>
<p>If a person publishes an edited version of the work, then they must use the same license.</p>
	<p>This is just an overview of CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, so <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0">reading the original page for the license will be good</a>, but the long and short is using an open license will be good, but if others want, using another license would be still okay.</p>
