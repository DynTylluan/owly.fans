<p>As of late, Owly made the error of checking out their old Twitter page and by doing so, she saw a bunch of old artwork that they stared and because over on at NeoZones we're all art nerds, we thought that you - our very nice reader - *might* enjoy some of the art that at this point is a bit old, <strong>but whatever</strong>, we can link old art!</p>

<p>What are you going to do about it, huh? Call the police like some kind of rat, eah, that's what I thought.</p>

<p>I (Owly) currently have two dogs that I love very much, but from what I can guess from other people, the term "wet dog smell" seems to be a thing that people REALLY do not like. I don't know if this is just me or not, but whenever my dogs get wet, they don't <em>really</em> smell all that much, and trust me, they just <em>love</em> to run around in march-y and boggy pools - regardless, the dog in this artwork made the right decision of putting on a raincoat plus also has an umbrella (very cute - I love it!).</p>

<p>catboots is an artist who just seems to pop-up everywhere in the furry community (not that I mind), I suspect that it's due to their cute art style that most seem to love. A person who also seems to also love their art (or at least this one) is my romantic partner, Robin, who found the following art to be very cute.</p>

Jordan Speer, who is the creature of this work, has been commisiioned in the past by names like Bloomberg Businessweek and The New York Times. The artwork of Speer can be seen as almost a 3D artiest version of Felix Colgrave, who is known for such videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_MSFkZHNi4&t=3s">DOUBLE KING</a>.</p>

	<p>Charles Davis is a person who I just cannot pin down; one moment they are taking selfies in public toilets, the next they are writing books, but one thing I am sure about is that Charles seems to be a genuinely nice person (meaning you should check them out!). Anyway, enjoy whatever this is.</p>

<p>Yep, it's art made by Jim'll Paint It, a UK-based artist who has been making artwork in MS Paint for... em... well a long time now, plus Jim has published a few books with all of the silly and fun stuff he has made in (that you should look for and buy!).</p>

<p>This time Jim has painted The Artist Formerly Known As Prince fighting Prince Harry while the Queen tries to twat Freddie Mercury.</p>

<p>Hey, uh, hi it's Owly here saying that, yes, this is only a poilet for a possible biweekly newsletter, much like the <a href="https://neozones.neocities.org/acidjaw/mail/issue0">old AcidMail</a>, we are trying this out to see what people would think of the idea.</p>
<p>Bascally, we want to have three factors as to if more issues will be made:</p>
<blockquote><p>One: More than two people care about this idea</p></blockquote>
<p>If no-one would have no intrest in reading it, I fail to see why I would want to put in the time to carry on making it, ya know?
<blockquote><p>Two: People are willing to help write it.</p></blockquote>
<p>AcidJaw was 90% written by myself and it took a lot of time and effort out of me, so it would be good to have other people to make content for this newsletter, such as art, web links, or even their own text.</p>
<blockquote><p>Three: If people <em>are</em> willing to make original content for this newsletter, it must be Creative Commons</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply so others can share</p>
