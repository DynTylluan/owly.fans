<p>Most games made in 1994 should have passed their sell-by date and be forgotten, but somehow <em>Doom</em> is an exception - the fandom for the game is as alive as it was when it was still cool to collect pogs. Every day you can find new fan-made levels being made for the game (known as WADs), while there certainly are several low-standard levels being made, a lot are amazing with fun gameplay that can even be better than the maps made for the original Doom.</p>

<p>Of course, just because a map is a little crap doesn't mean that it's terrible or anything, oh no, when we say &#xAB;Doom: Rediscovering History&#xBB;, we're talking about WADs that will stand the test of time due to how sheer trash they are... or sometimes weird and/or noticeable. So, I hope you're sitting comfortably because you're about to read about... <strong>Doom: Rediscovering History</strong>.</p>
