<h3>Did you know?</h3>
		<p>This Doom WAD was made by <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Scott_Harper_(MadMax)">Scott Harper</a> and <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Jim_Flynn">Jim Flynn</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, while Jim Flynn died in 2018, his contribution to the Doom community should not be understated, not only did he make a large number of WADs, including <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Eternal_Doom">ones for Eternal Doom</a> and <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Master_Levels_for_Doom_II">the Master Levels</a>, but he also worked on <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Boom">Boom with TeamTNT</a>, one of the first source ports for Doom that had many new features added, such as the removal of engine limits, removing bugs, and optimizing the engine.</p>

     Maps: MAP02, MAP03             Type: normal level

    Music: no

[ Level construction ] ----------------------------------------------

  A very large level  for all of you who  like puzzle-levels.  A lot
of large rooms  and hallways,  nevertheless mostly very detailed and
well constructed.  The level has a lot teleport-lines, you won&#x27;t see
them and you will mostly teleport to a place you don&#x27;t want. I don&#x27;t
like such things,  teleport-lines must  have a &#x22;real&#x22;  teleporter to
know where  to get.  Very confusing.  Luckily the  authors put  some
animations in the WAD which will show you how to reach keys etc... I
remember some very frustrating lava and waste places near the end...
However,  the level contains  many many nice ideas,  worth to take a
look at.  Nice light usage,  a few annoying  secrets  and due to its
size slow.
  There is another  level in this  big WAD,  but this  one really is
the top of frustration. You never know where to go, you have to push
all switches at  least 3 times before you  know what happens. Not to
speak of the very annoying Revenants, shooting from places above you
mostly impossible to kill. This really sucks. Ugly designed too.

[ Texture design ] --------------------------------------------------

  Mostly well aligned, but a lot of strange combinations of textures
and styles. Some doortraks are moving. Could be better.

[ Bugs ] ------------------------------------------------------------

  No HOMs, Medusa effects or Tutti-Frutties.

[ Enemies ] ---------------------------------------------------------

  Not very hard, you will get all weapons and the enemies are mostly
no real problem.  Some very nice traps and tricks, but overall a bit
easy.

[ Things ] ----------------------------------------------------------

  Enough ammo  and health.  In multiplayer  games will  be a lack of
ammo though.  Often you are  killing monsters with your last shells.
This changes and  at the end  you will have  a lot  of ammo.  Enough
other things placed - it&#x27;s slow enough.

[ Scoring ] ---------------------------------------------------------

  75%

  Worth  downloading. I found it very annoying, because I never knew
where to go,  which switches  will cause  what etc.  But this maybe,
because I don&#x27;t  like such puzzle-levels. If you like, this WAD will
take some time to get through...
