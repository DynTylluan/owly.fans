[ Level construction ] ----------------------------------------------

  Really illogical  key-placement (all  three keys are  in one  room
near to the exit,  even though with a lot  of monsters in it)... The
whole level has many little blocks and steps, windows and platforms,
different floor  levels and pools.  Very detailed,  but a bit  slow.
Various designed places,  hallways,  pools of blood, open sky parts,
some very dark places and a very &#x27;light&#x27; exit.  The author put a lot
of ideas in this level.
  Nice light usage, shadows etc.

[ Texture design ] --------------------------------------------------

  Many misaligned textures,  almost every switch is misplaced.  Some
very strange combinations of textures (red windows have white floors
and ceilings, but blue sides) - it looks a bit too colored.  However
it is not that bad.  Many ceiling textures  are misplaced, but lamps
(ceiling lights) and floors of lifts are okay. Doors and teleporters
are well done too.

[ Bugs ] ------------------------------------------------------------

  Noticed one  Tutti-Frutti-effect (a  door),  but no Medusa  or HOM
effect.

[ Enemies ] ---------------------------------------------------------

  Like every reviewed  level I played in UV only.  It is not easy to
kill everybody,  because there are  a lot of monsters.  However  the
player will  never be stuck with of ammo,  this makes the level very
fun to play.  No Cyberdemon or Spider Mastermind.  But a lot  Barons
and Imps. I&#x27;m not sure but I think I noticed some overload of things
and dead bodies - some dead guys disapeared...

[ Things ] ----------------------------------------------------------

  Enough ammo, but be  careful with  your health.  A lot of  things,
like trees, lamps etc.  This slows the game down a bit, but it makes
the level much more &#x27;real&#x27;.
  If you find a large  amount of ammo,  you will need it right after
getting it. :)

[ Scoring ] ---------------------------------------------------------

  70%

  Worth downloading. I liked playing it, but it would be much better
with aligned switches and maybe less a few things (makes it faster).
  The author should write down  a &#x27;plan&#x27; for placing the keys before
editing and do much more &#x27;fine tuning&#x27; after completing the level.
