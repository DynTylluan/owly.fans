    Title: NLDoom Series            Game: Doom 2
 Filename: <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames//index.php?search=1&field=textfile&word=NLDoom"><tt>NLDOOM2x.ZIP</tt></a> (x = 1-8)   Size: 32k-100k

   Author: Unknown              e-mail: <a href="mailto:nelsonl@linestone.kosone.com"><tt>nelsonl@linestone.kosone.com</tt></a>

     Maps: MAP01-MAP08 (8)          Type: normal/co-op levels
   Sounds: No
 Graphics: No
    Music: No

[ Level construction ] ----------------------------------------------

  8 levels with no special plan. Okay, the levels are getting bigger
but this doesn&#x27;t mean that they are getting better too... The levels
are classical  &#x27;shoot, run, pick-up, shoot again...&#x27; levels.  You do
not even have  to look for keys.  This means, the  NLDoom Series are
at most  one-way level. Of course they  contain keys,  but everytime
you need one, you already got the right one.
  The author likes labyrinths.  All levels contain a bug. At least I
think it is one.  If you die in green waste, you&#x27;ll finish the level
immediately. I don&#x27;t think this is useful...
  At all  you will  remember  some  parts of  the  levels  from  the
original Doom and Doom 2 game.
  Very  interesting  is  the  use  of a glass-effect;  you can  view
trough it,  but not  shoot and  the monsters  are not  &#x27;seeing you&#x27;.

[ Texture design ] --------------------------------------------------

  Some misaligned textures and in the first 4 levels the author used
very strange  combinations of textures.  This is getting &#x27;better&#x27; in
the last 4 levels, because the rooms are getting much bigger and the
author used some easier textures. Doors are at most okay, but in the
last 3 levels the  author didn&#x27;t  mark the  doors with red,  blue or
yellow walls. This sucks.
  Teleporters are not very good in the first 3 levels,  because they
have just some red floor. This is better in the last 5 levels.

[ Bugs ] ------------------------------------------------------------

  No Medusa  or HOM  effect.  However, I noticed  some  Tutti-Frutti
effects, especially at stairs. Some doortraks are moving...

[ Enemies ] ---------------------------------------------------------

  Good placed.  Nothing special, but  in the last  3 or 4 levels you
have to kill several spider masterminds and a few cyberdemons. It is
not very hard at all.

[ Things ] ----------------------------------------------------------

  Enough ammo, enough health. Quite easy to complete it.  Most rooms
are not containing any extra objects, such as Bodies or Lamps.  It&#x27;s
a bit  boring to have a  lot of empty rooms.  Luckily there are some
monsters in it. :)

[ Scoring ] ---------------------------------------------------------

  75%

  Worth downloading. Easy to run through; nothing new at all, except
the glass-effects.  Better than  a lot of  other PWADs for Doom 2. I
think they are good for co-op play. I recommend to put all 8 WADs in
one big file. You will need the weapons in further levels...

  To the author: please add a textfile to EVERY zip-file and use the
PWAD authoring template!!
