                          TiC's WAD Review
---------------------------------------------------------------------

          In irregular intervals I will review a few PWADs.
   All reviews are totally subjective, I'll not beautify anything!

    If you have any suggestions, ideas or whatever; e-mail me at:
      <a href="mailto:denis@doomsday.shnet.org"><tt>denis@doomsday.shnet.org</tt></a> or <a href="mailto:denis.moeller@kiel.netsurf.de"><tt>denis.moeller@kiel.netsurf.de</tt></a>

    All files can be found on ftp.cdrom.com and its mirror sites.
      DON'T ASK ME TO SEND YOU ANY FILES NOR WHERE TO GET THEM.

         If you want me to review a special PWAD - email me.
              I will NOT review any deathmatch-levels!

            You can also read my reviews at this WebPage:

[ Level construction ] ----------------------------------------------

  This level was originally designed for deathmatch. You will notice
that right after starting it.  I think the author  added a few rooms
and teleporters and thought this  would do a 'id-like' level. Wrong.
Okay, let's talk about the 'good' parts of  this level. The keys are
well placed; but the blue key is in a very hidden room in the 'sky',
I think this looks VERY ugly,  but I think the author thought it was
cool. However you can open the blue door without the blue key. Maybe
the author noticed that the room containing the key is too difficult
to find. ;) But then the way to  the blue door is hidden again,  not
just hidden - it is  impossible  to find,  even with cheats.  To the
author:  this sucks!  (Hint:  try to open  a silver wall)  All other
parts are looking very deathmatch-like and are well done.
  Very good light usage, such as shadows and strips of light.

[ Texture design ] --------------------------------------------------

  Very good texture usage and alignment. Clean work.

[ Bugs ] ------------------------------------------------------------

  No Tuttie-Frutti,  Medusa or  HOM effects.  Some 2-sided  textures
(those with Heavy-Weapon Dudes behind) are a bit wrong,  I think the
rooms are not high enough... however,  difficult to notice.  And you
can see the sky repeating below you, could be better.

[ Enemies ] ---------------------------------------------------------

  Huarks! Quite hard,  a lot of Heavy Weapon Dudes  and Guys at all,
a Baron and a few Cacos and Pigs. Very challenging.

[ Things ] ----------------------------------------------------------

  Enough ammo and health.  Good placed.  Very good  usage of 'other'
things, such as lamps, torches and barrels.

[ Scoring ] ---------------------------------------------------------

  68%

  Worth downloading. Yes, 65%.  Man, it would catch 85%  without the
annoying blue-key-room  and door.  Hope to see  some more  levels by
Michael.
