# OwlyFans

> You might be looking for [this git](https://github.com/dynTylluan/owlyfans.neocities.org), as this one is for the .fans version.

Due to the way that my website is set up, it means that whenever I edit [this git](https://github.com/DynTylluan/owly.fans), changes are seen on the [live website itself](https://owly.fans) - I have no issue in my website's contents being public, and in fact, I like it being that way.

If you have spotted an error, [please feel free to contact me](https://github.com/DynTylluan/DynTylluan) about it, or simply fork this git and send a pull request.
