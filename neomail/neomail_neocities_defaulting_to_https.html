<div dir="ltr"><div><div>Hello all, this is Jeremy here.<br><br></div>As you all probably now know, all Neocities sites default to HTTPS, i.e, unless you're using a very old browser that doesn't understand <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a>, it is now basically impossible to load your site over the (insecure) HTTP protocol.<br><br></div><div>Although this is probably a good thing in the long run, as <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.neocities.org/default-ssl.html">mentioned on the Neocities blog</a>, it will break some sites the way they're currently set up, <b>maybe even yours</b>.<br><br><i>However</i> -- Don't panic! I'm here to help&nbsp; :)<br><br></div><div>Step 1:<br><div style="margin-left:40px">Find and identify any resources (images, javascript, css, music, iframes, etc) loaded over http. Note that this also includes insecure links that open in frames.<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px"><br>Example: &lt;img src="<a href="http://example.com/exampl">http://example.com/exampl</a><wbr>e-image.jpg"&gt;<br><br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">Note that the most<b> </b>important changes you must make are to javascript, css, iframes, and "frame-links". Images and music will still sometimes be loaded over http, albeit often with a complaint from the browser.<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">However, browsers <b>WILL NOT</b> load any insecure javascript, css, or sites in iframes.<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">So focus your efforts there first!<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px"><br></div></div><div>Step 2:<br><div style="margin-left:40px"></div><div style="margin-left:40px"></div><div style="margin-left:40px">Anything hosted on another site that supports https, just change the protocol to either https, or "relative", which loads based on the protocol the page is being used over.<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">If it's another neocities site, this should be easy!<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px"><br>Example of https: &lt;img src="<a href="https://anlucas.neocities/">https://anlucas.neocities</a><wbr>.org/worldwideweb_badge.gif"&gt;<br>Example of relative: &lt;img src="//<a href="http://anlucas.neocities.org/w">anlucas.neocities.org/w</a><wbr>orldwideweb_badge.gif"&gt;<br><br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">If the site doesn't support https, you can do a couple different things:<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px"><div style="margin-left:40px"><br></div></div><div style="margin-left:40px">If the resource is, for example, something that's intended to be shared, or in the public domain like a 88x31 button gif, you can probably safely download and re-host it on your site<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">Example before: &lt;img src="<a href="http://www.hat.net/abs/gi">http://www.hat.net/abs/gi</a><wbr>f/noclick.gif"&gt; <br>Example after: &lt;img src="/noclick.gif"&gt;<br><br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">If the resource is very large, or you don't think you're allowed to re-host it, like music or propriety javascript, then you can try saving/hosting it in the <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a>, which supports https. Unfortunately, it also obeys <a target="_blank" href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt</a>, so this might not always work.<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">There are also a variety of music and other anonymous file hosting services, so trying googling around some too.<br><br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">Finally, if you have a link that opens in a frame that doesn't support https, just open it in a new tab! :)<br><br></div>Step 3:<br><div style="margin-left:40px">There is no no step three!<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">Congratulations, you're done! :D<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">See, that wasn't that hard.<br></div><br></div><div>Please feel free to share this, I am releasing it under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>.<br></div><div><br>Thank you for reading!<br><br>

I'm running out of ideas for my site, and I feel bad for not pushing out any more updates. I would appreciate some suggestions because my site is becoming kind of bland.<br>
Thanks, Nailed-It

Hi Nailed-It,
<P>
Looking at your site quickly, there is not much about you or your interests. That's the kinda stuff that makes a site fun to visit.
<P>
Looking at other sites and imitating things they do that you like is another great way to add to your site, its the internet after all, your supposed to steal stuff.
<P>
If I had to bullet point some things about your site. Pictures of food always look bad. The blue background is a bit much. The choice of pictures feels inconsistent in their style and resolution. The burger quiz and Santa thing is pretty novel that's good.
<P>
Since you seem to like making multiple choice quiz things you might consider making that the focus of your site.
<P>
All the best, Melon
