Hi Humans!<br>
Added Hamzak to the list.
<p>
I was thinking, one thing neocities (And the whole Web 1.0 movement) needs is some sort of award. Something that is handed out yearly in a number of categories, like Best CSS work, Most Unique Idea, etc. I'm not aware of any that exist at the moment?<br>
It would help encourage people to design better and try more unique things, and it would be a nice CV/Resume thing for anyone who won.
<p>
Perhaps if people are interested we could form some sort of committee to plan it out? Let me known.

I like the sound of that, infact, only the other day I was talking to Jakeonline (Design Choices) about the same thing and how good it would be to do something like that, I would love to see something like this on Neocities!
