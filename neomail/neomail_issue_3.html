Hi All, quick refresh to add Neko and Moon to the list. I have included the most recent discussion below for them.
<P>
Current Topic: Interdependently Archiving Neocities.
<P>
JeremyRedhead<br>
"I've been making it my thing to archive as many neocities sites as possible that I encounter on a regular basis due to their apparent volatility and knack for suddenly disappearing or changing drastically. However, I completely slipped up and dropped the ball on this, and because of this the only archives I'm aware of are these: <a href="https://archive.is/strangerkawaiithings.neocities.org">https://archive.is/strangerkawaiithings.neocities.org</a> As you can see, the js and css are missing, however I more or less remember what their site looked like, so maybe together we can all create a tribute site in case they don't return? Well, that's all."

"Archiving is an interesting issue, personally I think Neocities should archive all sites every 3 months or so, so its possible to see snapshots of sites as they evolve. Though I'd say Neocities would still want to delete archives of someones site if its deleted. I guess its the question of, does a person have the right to erase their contribution to the web, or does the public have the right to continue to see something even if its creator is gone.
<P>
My personal view is that once something is online it is public and a part of culture and people have the right to keep it accessible, so I think that's a noble cause :D
<P>
How are you doing the archiving? Is it all manual or do you have a program running that does it? It would be very cool to setup a small cloud server somewhere that had a list of sites to archive and a simple web crawler that backed them up every month to some cheap amazon storage then generated a neocities site with links to all the versions."
<P>
JeremyRedhead<br>
"At the moment I'm just manually archiving the sites in the Wayback Machine with the help of this little javascript bookmarklet:
<P><blockquote>
javascript:void(window.location='<a href="https://web.archive.org/save/'+document.location">https://web.archive.org/save/'+document.location</a>)
<P></blockquote>
but I have been thinking about setting up some sort of daemon that would archive anything showing up on the [site-wide] activity page which should catch most of Neocities, though I don't yet know how."
