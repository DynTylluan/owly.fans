Hi everyone, quick reissue to add rose and brain.<br>
<br>
I'm working on a lil guide site that has some tutorials and useful links <br>
for web masters and new neocities users. If you have any guides you've <br>
made that you'd like to have included send them my way, along with any <br>
suggestions for useful resources etc.<br>
<br>
Hope you're having a good February!<br>

Welcome to the unofficial Neocities mail group, we have started this up <br>
as a way for Neocities members to keep in touch outside of the main <br>
website. We will be sending out new issues every few weeks that contain <br>
some news, along with the most up to date list of people in the mail group.<br>
<br>
You're welcome to reply-all to the latest issue, it will act as a group <br>
discussion, however please remember not to spam.<br>
<br>
Please follow the group rules:<br>
* No Spam or unrelated content.<br>
* Don't send anything illegal, or that may be hurtful to other readers.<br>
