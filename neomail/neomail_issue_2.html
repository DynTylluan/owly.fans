Hi all,<br>
Quick reissue to add bootleg64 to the mail group.
<P>
As I'm sure you've all noticed, strangerkawaii has dropped off the face of the planet. This group was their idea so I'm not sure where to go from here xD It was made to keep people in contact if they became disconnected from neocities, so Ill keep adding new people, and leave old ones in unless they request otherwise!
<P>
Its also a fairly small group at the moment, so if anyone can help get the word around about joining that would help.<br>

Welcome to the unofficial Neocities mail group, we have started this up as a way for Neocities members to keep in touch outside of the main website. We will be sending out new issues every week or so, that contain some news, along with the most up to date list of people in the mail group.
<P>
You're welcome to reply-all to the latest issue, it will act as a group discussion, however please keep it to 1 or 2 replies a day.
<P>
Please follow the group rules:<br>
* No Spam or unrelated content.<br>
* Don't send anything illegal, or that may be hurtful to other readers.
<P> 
News of the Week: Neocities adds full WebVR screenshot support, have you considered a WebVR site?

I've been making it my thing to archive as many neocities sites as possible that I encounter on a regular basis due to their apparent volatility and knack for suddenly disappearing or changing drastically. However, I completely slipped up and dropped the ball on this, and because of this the only archives I'm aware of are these: <a href="https://archive.is/strangerkawaiithings.neocities.org">https://archive.is/strangerkawaiithings.neocities.org</A> As you can see, the js and css are missing, however I more or less remember what their site looked like, so maybe together we can all create a tribute site in case they don't return? Well, that's all.

Archiving is an interesting issue, personally I think Neocities should archive all sites every 3 months or so, so its possible to see snapshots of sites as they evolve. Though I'd say Neocities would still want to delete archives of someones site if its deleted. I guess its the question of, does a person have the right to erase their contribution to the web, or does the public have the right to continue to see something even if its creator is gone.
<P>
My personal view is that once something is online it is public and a part of culture and people have the right to keep it accessible, so I think that's a noble cause :D
<P>
How are you doing the archiving? Is it all manual or do you have a program running that does it? It would be very cool to setup a small cloud server somewhere that had a list of sites to archive and a simple web crawler that backed them up every month to some cheap amazon storage then generated a neocities site with links to all the versions.

At the moment I'm just manually archiving the sites in the Wayback Machine with the help of this little javascript bookmarklet:
<P><blockquote>
javascript:void(window.location='<a href="https://web.archive.org/save/'+document.location">https://web.archive.org/save/'+document.location</a>)
<P></blockquote>
but I have been thinking about setting up some sort of daemon that would archive anything showing up on the [site-wide] activity page which should catch most of Neocities, though I don't yet know how.
