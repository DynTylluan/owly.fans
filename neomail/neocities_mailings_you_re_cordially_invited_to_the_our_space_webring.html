An announcement that might be of interest to the folks on this list:
<p>
I created a webring for handcrafted sites, because it's something I wanted to exist. Looks like some other folks are into it too, which is nice... as of right now, 7 sites have joined. Hopefully it'll make browsing &#x26; discovery easier!
<p>
You can get more info &#x26; sign up here: <a href="https://ourspace.neocities.org/">https://ourspace.neocities.org</A>
<p>
[Note: the code has been updated recently. The new one does require you to upload images to your own server - you can choose from some I've supplied or use your own. If you placed the code before this, please update it.]
