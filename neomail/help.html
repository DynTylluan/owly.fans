<TABLE WIDTH=750><TD VALIGN=TOP><h1>A Guide to NeoMail...</h1>
<p>All the way back in 2016, <a href="https://melonking.net">MelonKing</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161129225422/http://strangerkawaiithings.neocities.org:80">Stranger Kawaii</a> came up with the idea of making a mailing list for people who were on Neocities, that being <a href="https://melonking.net/neomail.html">(unofficial) Neocities mailing list</a>, a unique way of staying in contact, that being via E-Mail.</p>

<p>The mailing list was quite popular, but with time it soon slowed down until it died one day, kind of a shame as it was fun, regardless, the reason why this archive was made is due to people just being unable to view the E-Mail letters of other people, so as a way for people to take a look in a bit of history that could have easily of been lost, this collection was made.</p>

<p>As this is meant to be an archive, errors that people made at the time have been preserved, for example on <a href="neomail_neocities_defaulting_to_https.html">NeoMail -- Neocities defaulting to https</a>, some of the links do not work. Related, but this also means that link rot will happen over time, meaning that addresses that people send will one day 404 - this will not be fixed.</p>

<p>For the sake of privacy, the E-Mail addresses of the people who took part have been removed</p>
