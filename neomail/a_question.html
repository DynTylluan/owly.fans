<div>Hi there,&nbsp;<span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">MuBok!</span></span><br></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I believe it's meant to be like that, it is, after all a tag. There should be no need to worry about it.</span></span><br></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Also, has your website changed address? I looked up "<a href="https://brainhole.neocities.org/">brainhole.neocities.org</a>"&nbsp;but just found a 404 page, I do know that there was once a website there, so I looked the address up in <a rel="nofollow" title="https://web.archive.org/web/20170218203212/https://brainhole.neocities.org/" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170218203212/https://brainhole.neocities.org/">The Internet Archive</a>, so, uh, yeah.</span></span>

		   <p>Hi all,</p>
    <p>Owl is correct, the neocities web editor defaults to show tags as
      red, however there is a dropdown box to change theme if you wish.
      Its purely for aesthetics and ease of read.<br>
    </p>
    <p>brians address has been changed to
      <a href="https://muboks-stuff.neocities.org/">https://muboks-stuff.neocities.org/</a> <br>
