Hello, this is a test page to show what I can do with image mapping, this is the first real thing that I have ever made with it. If you click on the parts of the image with the dotted line, then it will take you to a new part of the website.</p>
<p>
This page isn't meant to show off my own <em>amazing</em> skills in HTML, but as more as a way for a way to mess around with a new tool, that could be quite fun to use.</p>
<p>
The bit mapping was helped by the use of <a href="http://www.image-map.net/">image-map.net</a>, so thanks, guys!</p>
