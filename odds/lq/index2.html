	<p>The <em>LibreQuake</em> project aims to create a complete, free content first-person shooter game, but <em>LibreQuake</em> by itself is just the raw material for a game. It must be paired with a compatible engine to be played.</p>

	<p>There is a massive <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com">back catalogue</a>, spanning over two decades, containing thousands of <em>Quake</em> levels and other modifications (“mods”) made by fans of the game. <em>LibreQuake</em> aims to be compatible with these and allows most to be played without the need to use non-free software.</p>
