<p>The best way to talk about LibreQuake, get fast updates, and just chat about the game will be on our community Discord. Sadly, <em>yes</em>, you will need a Discord account and <em>yes</em>, Discord is very much not open-source. We know, but we also know that it's one of the most used chatting apps in-use right now. So, feel free to pop by - we won't bite!</p>
