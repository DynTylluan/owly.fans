>WHY, HELLO THERE ðŸ‘‹
Hello there, friends, welcome to issue 17B of AcidMail, still one of the worst things to have ever been made (yes, I know that you hate it here, I hate it here also, but we might not need to sit through this for very long).

This is a very special issue of AciMail made by just Cass "Owly" Python as an attempt at trying to get H Y P E around the possibility of continuing AcidMail, but look -- we're jumping the gun here a little bit, aren't we? So, what *is* an AcidMail?

First started in 2020, AcidMail was the name of a newsletter co-written by people that would be published weekly on the 'net for the viewing "pleasure" of you (yes, YOU!), the idea of the newsletter was that it was not going to be like most of the newsletters that you might subscribe to as we have attitude, yo, and we will take open jabs at the reader (we love you really XOXOXO) while trying to stay light-hearted and trying to ignore the, quite frankly, bleak news of the world that was going on at the time.

The newsletter could be quite experimental at times, such as with issue 6 that was mostly written by Talk to Transformer, a neural network that was made to try and complete text - another example of noticeable things that we did was with issue 13 where we got our readers to make whatever they wanted to do in JS Paint, what was at the time a fairly new webapp made to run like MS Paint.

When the newsletter was first started, NeoZones was quite the small community, being mostly made up of people who were being hosted on the site, however, since the newsletter stopped, a lot has changed and we really have gotten out sticky fingers in a lot of pies, and because of this, I think that it could be worth a shot to try and resurrect this newsletter. If you like the look of this newsletter and think that you can help with it, such as writing something for it or even suggesting a link, join https://neozones.club/discord

For a possible test run, we hope to show you what AcidMail can be and we (uh, well *I*) hope that you enjoy it a lot.

>CHECK OUT SOME COOL ART, YO
As of late, Owly made the error of checking out
their old Twitter page and by doing so, she saw
a bunch of old artwork that they stared and
because over on at NeoZones we're all art nerds,
we thought that you - our very nice
reader - *might* enjoy some of the art that at
this point is a bit old, BUT WHATEVER, we can
link old art!

What are you going to do about it, huh? Call the
police like some kind of rat, eah, that's what I
thought.

: DOG IN THE RAIN
: https://twitter.com/3eyedog/status/1278260415743627265
I (Owly) currently have two dogs that I love very
much, but from what I can guess from other
people, the term "wet dog smell" seems to be a
thing that people REALLY do not like. I don't
know if this is just me or not, but whenever my
dogs get wet, they don't _really_ smell all that
much, and trust me, they just _love_ to run
around in march-y and boggy pools - regardless,
the dog in this artwork made the right decision
of putting on a raincoat plus also has an
umbrella (very cute - I love it!).

: 9 BY CATBOOTS
: https://twitter.com/catboots/status/1145394581409808384
catboots is an artist who just seems to pop-up
everywhere in the furry community (not that I mind), I
suspect that it's due to their cute art style that most
seem to love. A person who also seems to also love
their art (or at least this one) is my romantic
partner, Robin, who found the following art to be very
cute.

For myself, I liked COLOSSUS the best:

: WHATEVER THIS IS BY CHARLES DAVIS
: https://twitter.com/DaveCenobite/status/1133067319587086336
Charles Davis is a person who I just cannot pin
down; one moment they are taking selfies in
public toilets, the next they are writing books,
but one thing I am sure about is that Charles
seems to be a genuinely nice person (meaning you
should check them out!). Anyway, enjoy whatever
this is.

: THE PINK CAT ART-TRAIN
: https://twitter.com/Orlando_Fox/status/829590831812243456
More furry artwork, because I can do whatever I
like, this time by OrlandoFox who brings us
fanart of the Pink Panther and Snagglepuss, two
cool cats

: PRINCE VS. PRINCE HARRY
: https://twitter.com/Jimllpaintit/status/1246112940786364416
Yep, it's art made by Jim'll Paint It, a UK-based
artist who has been making artwork in MS Paint
for... em... well a long time now, plus Jim has
published a few books with all of the silly and
fun stuff he has made in (that you should look
for and buy!).

This time Jim has painted The Artist Formerly
Known As Prince fighting Prince Harry while the
Queen tries to twat Freddie Mercury.

>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now (remember that?) is a...
a... ""weekly"" thing that we do that shows off
some (mostly) old art from the WWW that people
might not fully know or care all that much about.
Please enjoy at your own risk.

I might as well show this off, but the other day I found an open directory of old furry artwork that I'm guessing was published circa 1998 via CD-ROM!

There is some NSFW around on the directory, but it is still interesting to see such old artwork and how the whole ~vibes~ of furry artwork has changed over the years since.

The art shown here was by Andrew "fnook" Powell.
