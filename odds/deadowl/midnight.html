            What is "The Midnight Prowler"?
            As of late, I have been in touch with a person who knows
            someone who works in the police, and I was able to get my
            hands on a part of the diary for Harry Chandler. I'm not
            fully sure when this was dated, I'm guessing it was early
            November 1998, as according to my friend in the know how,
            this was near the end of the diary.
            <p>
              Anyway, I'm not going to write any-more, so I'll just show
              you the text</p>
            <tt> The Midnight Prowler
              <p> I am the Midnight Prowler, son of the moon And I am
                the child of the 42 generation....
              </p>
              <p> I wish for the day that I will return to England, so I
                may once again walk upon its pure virgin lands of green
                fields, I wish for my feet to touch the soft long grass,
                and feel the slow sea on my skin, like we did in the age
                of the Gods.
              </p>
              <p> I will fight for England, I will fight for what I
                believe is right: Let us drink knowing that England will
                sleep well, knowing that no Saxon will touch the pure
                virgin land of Great Britain! If the Saxons try and
                touch our pure, and most Holy land, then we will take
                action, and show them our metal!
              </p>
              <p> We shell rejoice in knowing that the Saxons do not
                have God on their side, and will die like fools. When we
                have shown the Saxons out mite, then we shell drink for
                a thousand, and one years the fruits of the Gods!
              </p>
			  <p></tt>
			  After I got this, I really wanted to know what it was about, I was able to speak directly to the unnamed person, and they were able to tell me about it.
			  <p>
			  It would seem that <i>The Midnight Prowler</i> was a unholy being that would walk in the dark of the earth. The Midnight Prowler has, and always will be around.
			  <p>
			  The cult believed that The Midnight Prowler was born on the moon, but would soon live in the UK, but was forced out by the Romans, however, The Midnight Prowler would return back to the UK if any Saxons come back. Weird stuff.
