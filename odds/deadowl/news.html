            <h2><font size="+3">News Reports on The Cult</font></h2>
            <p> A small number of news reports have been found over the
              years, most of the reports were made after the cult's
              suicide, here are all of the once that we have found.<br>
            </p>
            <p align="left">Our first report is a clipping from an
              unknow UK newspaper, it is dated as the 26 of November
              1998. The report uses one of the only known images of the
              island that was taken by the police at the time.<img

              We would like to thank a fello friend on AIM who sent us
              this report from The Holly Times, a UK newspaper that
              reported on the cult in 1997...</p>
            <p><tt>Worry As Cult Takes Over Whitewood<br>
                <br>
                Last year the island of Whitewood was a simple farmland
                community, but as reports have come in from a former
                member of the island, not everything is what it seems to
                be...<br>
                <br>
                Johnny Kilmister reported to The Holly Times yesterday
                that on the island of Whitewood, there is a so-called
                "cult" that believe that Jesus Christ will return to the
                earth in the coming years. Kilmister told us that the
                leader (who will not be named in this report for privacy
                reasons) first started to gain a following in late 1995
                and would soon start a new-wave-Christian cult that is
                known as 'The Fellowship of The Dead Owl'. They would
                practice satanic rituals while playing heavy metal
                albums.<br>
                <br>
                While the cult would practice their ritual they would
                speak about a pure Great Britain. Kilmister would tell
                us that they also believed that the UK would be ruled by
                a new leader called "The Midnight Prowler" in the year
                2014.<br>
                <br>
                when asked about this, the head of Police Force UK told
                us that the island was "no worry" to us.</tt><br>

              The next report comes in from a close friend of mine who
              also my interest in this event. This report comes in from
              Viking, a paper that was published in the UK from 1907 to
              2000, this report was made sometime around mid April 1997.<img
