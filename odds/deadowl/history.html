            <p>&nbsp;The Chandler family wanted to put their past behind
              them, so as an effort, moved to Whitewood, a small island
              with a population of just over 100 people at any given
              time. The family would soon become quite well-known on
              this island, even getting to the point where they managed
              to gain the most land to crop.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Harry would soon start his education at The St. Dio
              Church of England School, where he learnt the story of
              God, and his only son, Jesus Christ. Harry would grow fond
              of the many stories in The Bible, he especially enjoyed
              reading and learning about the many bloody parts in the
              Holy Book. Harry would write in his diary about how much
              the idea of war excited him. Over the year of 1999, a
              number of documents made by the police were leaked, among
              the reports were of his diary, written when he was around
              16.<br>
              <br>
              His diary contained a large number of references to that
              of religious texts, including what could be considered to
              be the start of what would become The Fellowship of The
              Dead Owl.<br>
              <br>
              As Harry got in his late teens, he started to develop an
              unnormal obsession with animals, most noticeably he had an
              interest in birds, especially in owls. Harry would
              sometimes go out in the middle of the night with an air
              rifle, and shoot birds. He would then take them home, and
              conduct his own sick, and twisted experiments on the
              animals. Around this time his mother would develop
              tetanus, and needed t be taken back to mainland Britain to
              be treated, as the island only had a very basic supply of
              drugs.<br>
              <br>
              In 1982, Harry's mother's health got much worse, soon his
              father decided that it was best that he should visit his
              wife, as she was very near Death's door.<br>
              <br>
              Harry was left on his one to look after the crops, and
              farm animals. Not much is known about late 1982 in the
              Chandler family, only that Harry's father, John, lived in
              mainland England with his wife.<br>
              <br>
              On the 2nd of January 1983, Helen Saxon lost her life. It
              is unclear when she was born, some people suspect that she
              was in her early 50, but even that is debated. Helen's
              final resting place would be at sea.<br>
              <br>
              This event would lead to Harry going deeper down the
              rabbit hole that was his insanity. It is known that Harry
              would start to take a large number of psilocybe mushrooms
              (better known as "magic mushrooms"), that grew on the land
              of Whitewood. It was thanks to this that he was able to
              come up with his many strange ideas, for example, he
              believed that "Christ" "told" him that he should start up
              a new religion.<br>
              <br>
              What is quite amazing is that he was able to indeed start
              up a new form of Christianity, and was even able to gain a
              large number of followers.<br>
              <br>
              The religion was officially called "New Christian",
              however, this name didn't really last long, as people in
              the cult would start to call it "The Fellowship of The
              Dead Owl", Harry himself would adopt this name. The
              religion believed in the majority of The Bible, however,
              the cult would take more of a Satanice root, so much so
              that they would conduct a large numbers of black masses.
              No photos or videos of these events were taped, however,
              they were recorded by non-cult members in the form of
              text-logs.<br>
            </p>
            <p>According to events written down, the members of the cult
              would set up a large fire, hold hands, and run around the
              fire, all while whering potato-like bags over their head,
              to potect who they were. While this was going on, Harry
              Chandler would sit down, and quote lines from The Bible. </p>
