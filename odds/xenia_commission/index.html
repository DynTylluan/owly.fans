<h1>Xenia Commission, May 2023</h1>
<hr>
<p>For this commission, I would like to have artwork drawn of <a href="https://xenia-linux-site.glitch.me">Xenia the Linux foxgirl</a> sitting down in a green field on a sunny day by a tree with some clouds in the sky. She is relaxing while on her laptop and is smiling away.</p>

<p>She should have on shorts and is barepaws. She has a hair clip that has the trans flag colors on. She has long hair that is not tied up. Xenia has on a pair of round glasses.</p>
				
		<p>Here is an example of the hairclip from <a href="https://meow.social/@rinidisc/109713069555919700">another person's art</a>:</p>
				<p><center><img src="hair.png" title="A snippet of artwork by RiniDisc that is the top of Xenia's head that shows her hair and a hairclip that has the trans flag on." alt="A snippet of artwork by RiniDisc that is the top of Xenia's head that shows her hair and a hairclip that has the trans flag on."></center></p>

		<p>Her t-shirt should say &#xAB;Linux&#xBB; on it, <a href="linux.png">like this image</a>, and she should have a breast outline.</p>
	
			<p>It would be cool if you could try and draw stickers on the laptop, such as having the <a href="librequake_logo.png">LibreQuake logo on</a> and/or the <a href="../../floppy.png">flippy disc</a> icon for this website.</p>
			
		<p>Ideally, the artwork would be A4 (2480 x 3508 pixels) and safe for work.</p>
			
		<p><a href="#Colors"><h3>Colors</h3></a><a name="Colors"></a></p>
		<p>Here are the hex colors that you might like to follow. These colors are only a suggestion.</p>
		<p>Head hair: Xenia has dirty blonde hair, using colors like <font color="#DB8D45">#DB8D45</font> and <font color="#B9773D">#B9773D</font>.</p>
		
		<p>T-shirt: The main part of the shirt uses <font color="#29261F">#29261F</font> while the font is <font color="#DFDC60">#DFDC60</font>.</p>
		<p>Shorts: Her shorts are <font color="#576554">#576554</font></p>
		
				<p><a href="#My Sketch"><h3>My Sketch</h3></a><a name="My Sketch"></a></p>
		<p>Here is a visual sketch of something that I might like to be made.</p>
			
		<p><center><img src="xenia_commission_cass.png" title="The sketch by Cass that shows Xenia in a field leaning against a tree while on a laptop." alt="The sketch by Cass that shows Xenia in a field leaning against a tree while on a laptop."></center></p>
