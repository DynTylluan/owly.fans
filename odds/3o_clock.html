<p>This is a recording 3o_clock.swf, made by Macop in 2003.</p>

<p>This is a Flash file that I have been aware of since around 2016 when I first downloaded it onto my crapy old laptop, I'm guessing that I must have first found the file on 4chan's /f/ (Flash) board and I must have thought that it was quite cool, so much so that I saved it.</p>

<p>Adobe Flash was discontinued on 2021-01-01, and rather than downloading a doggy, older version of Flash from some shady website, I opted to use ruffle (<a href="https://ruffle.rs">https://ruffle.rs</a>), a very cool Flash Player emulator built in the Rust programming language that is _very_ easy to use (just drag 'n' drop the .SWF file onto ruffle). The recording was made thanks to me using OBS Studio (<a href="https://obsproject.com">https://obsproject.com</a>).</p>

<p>I am not the creator of this movie, but I have uploaded it to YouTube as a way for people to easily view older movies that they might not have known fully about. Please support Macop, their Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/macop_uwf">https://twitter.com/macop_uwf</a></p>

<p>If you wish to download the SWF or movie, follow one of these two links (they will likely auto-download):</p>

<p>Okay! That's it when it comes down to my comments, have a nice night :-)</p>
